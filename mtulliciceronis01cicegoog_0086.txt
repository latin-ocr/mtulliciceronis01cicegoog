(M), who is now engaged in editing Cicero lor the Teubner series oi
texts. The net resultes my Judgment upon the evidence is a text
which lies considerably nearer to the uss than that os all three editors
just mentioned. All of them, as 1 think my notes ¹will show, have
altered many passages unneeessarily. This is chiefly due to the saer
that, good Latinists and critics as they are, they fail at many points
from wantos a special study ol the ancient sources sor the philosophie
doctrines with which the Academica deals lt is not possible sasely to
construet a text sor any one os Cicero’s philosophical writings from a
knowledge ol latin alone, and least oi all ior the Academica. ll 1 have
been able, as I think l have, to correct in a good many passages, on
grounds ol Latin criticism alone, the judgments ol these three editors,
the reason is that 1 have known the textos this book nearly by heart ior
many years, and have thus been enabled to bring to bear upon it at
once anything germane to it which has come before me in the course ot*
prolonged reading largely directed to this special end.

d. Ι now proeeed to mention some other matters more or less
closely connected with the textual criticism ol the book.

1. ln the library ol the University os Cambridge there is a copy
oi the edition oi Stephanus oi 1538, 1539, which once belonged to
. P. Faber, and has annotations apparently in his handwriting¹. Out of
respect sor Faber’s uame,1 have gone carefully through thern, but find
nothing ol any value in them. They as a rulc either give the readings
ot' Lambinus or references to passages in Greek and latin authors.
Only in a lew instanees do these written annotations disagree with those
printed by Faber, and they never add anything os importance.

a. The codr'ces Elr'enscs quoted by Davies have long been a puzzle
to scholars For most laets that are known concerning them I may
refer to Prot'. J. B. Mayor's introduction to his edition ol the De natura
deorum¹. Davies speaks at different times os three codrics Elienses. One
oi these seems to have been a real codex, containing the Tusculan Dis·
putatrbns only. The other two were not properly codries at all, but two
sets ol various readings professing (it appears) to be drawn lrom two uss,
and written in the margin of a copy ol Stephanus' Cicero (1538-9).
Oi these uss (if they really existed) only one contained the Academica
Postmbra, while both contained the lucullus. A carclul examination
