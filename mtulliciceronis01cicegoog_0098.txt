you; 11 you can answer and yet relrain, you are uniair (94). The art you admire
really undoes itsell, as Penelope did her web; witness the menrr'ens (95). You assent

to arguments which are identical in lorm with the nuntiem, and yet reluse to assent
to it. Why so? (96) You demand that these sophisms should be made exceptions to
the rulcs 01 Dialectic l'ou must go to a tribune 101 that exception. l just remind
you that Epicurus would not allow the very first postulate 01 your Dialectic (97). Iu
my opinion (and 1 learned Dialectic 11001 Antiochus) the mmteexr and the arguments
identical with it in lorm must stand or 1011 together (98).

ξς 98-105. Part vl 01 Cicero's exposition. An explanation 01 the constmctive
side 01 Cameadcs’ philosophy. ln order to overthrow at once the case 01 Antiochus,

1 procced to explain, aller Clitomachus, the whole 01 Cameades' system (98). Car· ἡ .

neades laid down two divisions 01 uisa. one into those capable 01 being perceived
and those not so capable, the other into probable and improbable. Arguments
aimed at the senses concern the first division only; the sapr‘cns will follow proba-
bility, as in many instances the Stoic sapiens conlcssedly does (99, 100). The Aca.
demic sapiens is not made 01 010110 ; many things serm to him true; yet he always ieels
that there is a possibility 01 their being false. The Stoics themselves admit that the
0011000, 010 often deceived. Put this admission together with the tenet 01 Epicurus,
and perception becomes impossible (101). lt is strange that our probabile does not
seem sufficient to you. Hear the account given by Clitomachus (roa). He condemns
those who say that sensation is swept away by the Academyy nothing is swept away
but its naessary certainty (103). There are two modes 01 wlthholding assent ς with·
holding it absolutely and withholding it merely so lar as to deny the certainty os
phenomena. The latter mode leaves all that is required 101 ordinary 1110 (104).

ξ( ros-11¹. Part vu 01 Cicero's exposition. Probability ls a sufficient ground
lor action. (Reply to 11 and ιν 01 Lucullus’ exposition.) llou must see, Lucullus,
by this time, that your deience 01 dogmatismis overthrown (105). You asked how
memory was possible on my principles. Why, did not Siron remcmber the dogmas 01
Epicurus? 11 nothing can be remembered which ls not absolutely true, then these
willbetruelrod). Probability is quite sufficient basis 101 the arts. One strong point
01 yours is that nature compels us locassent. But Panaetius doubted even some
01 the Stoic dogmas, and you yourseli reluse assent to the sordem why then should
not the Academlc doubt about other things? (roy) Your other strong point is that
without assent action is impossible (108). But surely many actions 01 the dog·
matist proceed upon mere probability. Nor do you gain by the use 01 the hackneyed
argument 01 Antiochus (109). Where probability is, there the Academic has all the
knowledge he wants (110). The argument 01 Antiochus that the Academica first
admit that there are true and 10100 uisa and then contradict themselves by denying
that there is any dillerence between true and 1010010 absurd. We do not deny that
the dillerence oriris,¹ we do deny that human lacultlcs are capable 01 surely grasping
the differeoce (111).

matist, which set 01 opinions is he to adopt? 11 1 had to deal with a Peripatetic,

whose definitioni are not 00 eracting, my course would be easier; 1 should not much
oppose him even 11 he maintained that the wise man sometimes opines (ira). The
definitions 01 the real Old Acadcmy are more reasonable than those 01 Antiochus.
llow, holding the opinions he does, can he profess to belong to the Old Academy?
