not the Academica then the De labibus. Cicero had never been very
intimate with Varro 3 their acquaintance seems to have been maintained
through Atticus, who was at all times anxious to draw them more
closely together. Nine years earlier he had pressed Cicero to find
room in his works for some honourable employment of Varro’s name‘.
The nature of the works on which Cicero was then engaged rendered it
difficult for him to comply with the request³. Varro had promised on
his side to dedicate to Cicero an important work. In answer to the
later entreaty of Atticus, Cicero declared himself very much dissatistied
with Varro's failure to fulfil his promise From this it is evident that
Cicero knew nothing of the scope or magnitude of the De lr'rgua
Latina, a portion of which Varro afterwards dedicated to him. His
complaint that Varro had been writing for two years without making
any progress shows how little familiarity there can have been between
the ῑινο*ο Cicero was minded to wait for Varro’s promised gift and then
to repay it by a richer present³. But, apart from these causes for
grumbhng‚ Cicero thought the new suggestion of Atticus a ‘ godsend ’ ⁰.
Since the Dc stlitibus was already ‘betrothed' to Brutus ⁷, he promised
to transfer to Varro the Academia, allowing that Catulus and Lucullus,
though of noble birth, had no claim to be considered learned ⁸. So little
learning did they possess that they could not even have dreamed of the
doctrines they had been made in the first edition of the Academica to
maintain’. For them another place was to be found, and the remark
