far the greatest, Cicero said, of all the Peripatetics he had himself
heard and indeed equal in merit to the most eminent of that school¹.

The care of that disordered province Cilicia was enough to employ
Cicero’s thoughts till the end of 50. Yet he yearned for Athens and
philosophy. He wished to leave some memorial of himself at the
beautiful city, and anxiously asked Atticus whether it would look
foolish to build a πρόπυλον at the Academia, as Appius, his predecessor,
had done at Eleusis¹. It seems the Athenians of the time were in the
habit of adapting their ancient statues to suit the noble Romans of
the day, and of placing on them fulsome inscriptions. Of this practice
Cicero speaks with loathing. ln one letter of this date he carefully
discusses the errors Atticus had pointed out in the books De re
publica³. His wishes with regard to Athens still kept their hold upon
his mind, and on his way home from Cilicia he spoke of conferring
on the city some signal favour⁴. Cicero was anxious to show Rhodes,
with its school of eloquence, to the two boys Marcus and QuintuS,
who accompanied him, and they probably touched there for a few
days⁵. From thence they went to Athens, where Cicero again stayed
with Aristus‘‚ and renewed his friendship with other philosophers,
among them Xeno the friend of Atticus⁷.

On Cicero’s return to Italy public affairs were ina very critical

condition, and lest little room for thoughts about literature. The
letters which belong to this timeare very pathetic Cicero several

times contrasts the statesmen of the time with the Scipio he had him-
self drawn in the De re publr'ca'5 when he thinks of Caesar, Plato's
description of the tyrant is present to his mind⁹ ; when he deliberates
about the course heis himself to take, he naturally recalls the example of
Socrates, who refused to leave Athens amid the misrule of the thirty
tyrants ¹⁰. It is curious to find Cicero, in the very midst of civil war,
poring over the books of Demetrius the Magnesian concerning concord ¹¹ ;
or employing his days in arguing with himselfa string of abstract

philosophical propositions about tyranny ¹¹. Nothing could more clearly
show that he was really a man of books3 by nothing but accident
