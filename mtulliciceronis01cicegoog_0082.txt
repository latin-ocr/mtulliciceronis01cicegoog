the whole of Cicero's philosophical works excepting the Lucullus, and

ιι. P. A Paris n1s3 no. 6331, once known as codex l'ulcunus,¹
written οιι parchment and containing the De finibus, and Academica J,

ln my critical notes I have given all the readings os these twelve uss ·
which are ol any importance. The lirst eight l have collated mysell.
For the readings ol U 1 have¹ had to depend on the collation given by
the Oxlord editors ol 1783, although 1 have found the inlomration they
give about E and ψ so untrustworthy that I can put little saith in their
report ol U. The readings ol G P V 1 have taken lrom Halm¹.

Of these uss no one, in my opinion, stands out as conspicuously
better than the rest Halm, and alter him Baiter, and to a still greater
degree C. F. W. Miiller, have attributed much importance to the ‘codex
Cannensis) I believe l have made it clear in my critical notes that
this us is largely interpolated and corrected by its copyist, who was
undoubtedly a good scholar. It may be affirmed with confidence that
all existing uss of Academr'ca I are ultimately derived from a single
archetype. This archetype was, as Ι conjecture, not very much older
than its descendants, and was probably Italian by origin. The follow·
ing passages, where all known uss agree, will be lound to support these
conclusionsffi
