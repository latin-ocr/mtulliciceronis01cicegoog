maining nine The other three later τρόποι are logical tricks, directed
against the possibility of demonstration, no one os which is exactly
given in the Araderrrt'co. The first shows that prool is impossible,
because to prove anything assumptions must be made, and these
assumptions require prooi, and soon ad inlinitum. The second meets
the claim of the dogmatist to have some unproved hypothesis admitted
as a basis ol proof, by pointing out that the sceptic can easily propose
an unproved hypothesis destructive of that put sorward on the other
side¹. The last ‘method' is the ‘method of altemation².’ To dis-
tinguish a true from a salse prooi a criterion is needed, but to show
the criterion true a proos is needed and so the argument oscillates to
inlinity between criterion and proof. These three ‘tropes’ were no doubt
constructed out os ancient material. The first os the three can be ’
definitely traoed back to T imon³, and involves (like the other two) a
difficulty felt with the lirst dawn ol logie

The two ‘tropes' which Sextus attributes to some later sceptics
really constitute the horns os a dilemma, which showed that in every
instance where knowledge was asserted, one ol two among the five
‘tropes’ might be used, viz. that based on the diversity os judgmentS,
and that which calls for prool upon prooi to inlinity⁴.

The eight socalled τρόποι of Aenesidemus stand on quite a different
footing lrorn all the other schemes Τ hey bear the stamp os original
invention and have no counterparts in the speculation of earlier times.
They were directed to the overthrow ol the Stoic theory oi causes.

Every editor ol Cicero’s philosophical works must at present depend
largely upon the evidence concerning mss which is presented by Baiter
and Halm in their continuation oi Orelli’s second edition ol Cicero's
works (zurich, 1861). The recension given oi the Academico is by K. 1
Halm, who supplies all the readings os four mss ior the Academico
