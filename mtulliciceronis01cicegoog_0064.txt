at Bauli¹. In the evening, ir the wind favoured, Lucullus was to leave
sor his villa at Neapolis, Cicero sor his at Pompeii ². Bauli was a little
place on the gulf os Baiae, close to Cimmerium, round which many
legendslingered⁸. The scenery in view was magnificent⁴. As the party
were seated in the xystus with its polished floor and statues and shrubs,
the waves rippled at their leet, and the sea away to the horizon glistened
and quivered under the bright sun, and changed colour under the fresh-
ening breeze. Within sight lay the shore at Cumae and Puteoli, thirty
stadia distant⁸.

Cicero strove as usual to give vividness to the dialogue and to keep
it perfectly free from anachronisms. Diodotus is spoken ol as still living,
although· when the words were written he had been dead sor some
ym‘. The surprise os Hortensius, who is buta leamer in philosophy,
at the wisdom os Lucullus, is very dramatic⁷. The many political and
private troubles which were pressing upon Cicero when he wrote the
work are kept carefully out of sight. Still we can catch here and there
traces of thoughts and plans which were actively employing the author's
mind at Astura. His intention to visit Tusculum has lest its mark on
the last section os the book, while in the last but one the De Rirr'bus,
the Dc Natura Deorum and other works are shadowed forth⁸. In
another passage the design of the Tusculaa Dbputations, which was
carried out immediately aster the publication os the Academica and De
malus, is clearly to be seen'.

Hortensius and Catulus now sink to a secondary position in the
conversation, which is resumed by Lucullus, His speech is especially
acknowledged by Cicero to be drawn from the works os Antiochus ¹⁰.
Nearly all that is known ol the learning of Lucullus is told in Cicero's
dialogue, and the passages already quoted from the letters He seems
at least to have dallied with culture, although his chief energy, asa
private citizen, was directed to the care of his fishponds¹¹. In his train
