58 THE AcAnEMrcs or clearco.

jectures on indirect evidence of a very shadowy kind The theory of
C. F. Hermann, that Philo returned to Plato’s doctrine of the ἴδεαι, is
destitute of all probability¹. Zeller thinks that Philo merely restated
with greater emphasis the Carneadean theory of probability⁹. This he
concludes from a passage in the Academica which may refer to Philo
especially, though that is far from certain³. It is moreover difficult to
see why Philo should have been described as the founder or one of
the founders of a forrrtlr Academy (in succession to the Academies of
Flam, Arcesilas and Carneades⁴) unless he gave utterance to some
doctrine which was supposed to be novel. According to Cicero, when
Antiochus first became acquainted with Philo's new views, he con-
fidently appealed to a philosopher well acquainted with the history
of the Academy, to say whether he had ever heard of such doctrines
being preached by any professed adherent of the school⁸. From
another passage of Cicero it appears that Philo, while he asserted that
the Academic school had been perfectly consistent from first to last,
from the time of Plato to his ownl, and while he treated the supposed
contrast between Old and New Academy as adelusion, yet endeavoured
to minimise the effect of the destructive criticism advanced by Arcesilas
and Carneades, and so to show that the history of the New Academy
had been generally misunderstood⁷. Hence he was openly charged with
lying, not only by Antiochus, but by Catulus the elder. That the ‘lie‘
of Philo, about the nature of which there hasbeen much discussion, must
have consisted inan attempt to put a new complexion on the sceptical
teaching of Arcesilas and Carneades, must be clear to any one who
attentiveiy considers the passages in which the ‘lie’ is mentioned⁸. In
all probability Philo argued that the solvent analysis which the New
Academic leaders applied to the Stoic criterion of truth did not express
their own views, but was merely a justifiable polemical expedient. He
