INTRODUCYION. 79

will do so in many other circumstances in lile. All this talk about dreamers, mad·
men and drunkards is unworthy our attention (53).

(ἐμ-63. Part v111 ol Lucullus' exposition. Final criticisms. The Academics
fail tosee that such doctrines do away with all probability even. 'lheir talk about
twins and seals is childish (54). They press into their service theold physical
philosophers, though ordinarily none are so much ridiculed by them (55). De-
mocritus may say that innumemble worlds exist in every particular similar to
ours, but l uppeal to more cultivated physicists, who maintain that each thing has
its own peculias marks (55, 56). The Servilii were distinguished from one another
hy their friends, and Delian breeders ot' iowls could tell from the appearance oi an
egg whicb hen had laid it (56, 57). We, however, do not much care whether we
are able to distinguish egga from one another or not. Another thing that they say

is absurd, via. that there may be distinction between individual sensations, but not be- ’

tween classes oi sensations (58). Equally absurd are those ‘probable and undis·
turbed' sensations they profess to lollow. The doctrine that true and false sensations
are indistinguishable logically leads to the unqualified ἐποχὴ ol Arcesilas (59). What
nonsense they talk about inquiring aster the nuth, and about the bad intluence ol
authority! (όο) Can you, Cicero, the panegyrist ol philosophy, plunge us into more
than Cimmerian darkness? (61) By holding that knowledge is impossible, you
weaken the lorce oi your famous declaration that you ‘knew all about’ Catiline.
Thus ended Lucullus, amid tbe continued wonder ol Hortensius (62, 63). Then
Catulus said that he should not be surprised if the speech oi Lucullus were to induce
me to change any view (63).

864-71. Part 1 ol Cicero’s exposition. Preliminary criticisms ol the position
oi Antiochus Cic. mucb moved thus begins: 'l'lre strength os Lucullus' argument
has affected me much, yet Ι leel thut it can be answered. First, however, l must
speak something that concems my character (64). l protest my entire sincerity in all
that l say. and would confirm it by an oath, were that proper (65). I am apassionate
inquiret alter truth, and on that very account hold it disgraceiul to assent to what is
false. ldonot deny that 1 make slips; but we must deal with the snpr'ens, whose
characteristic it is never to err in giving his assem (66). Hear Arcesilas' argumenta
il the sapim ever gives bis assent, he will be obliged to optim but he never will apiae,
’ therefore he never will give his assent. 'lhe Stoics and Antiochus deny the first oi
these statements. on the ground that it is possible to distinguish between true and
salse (6)). Even il it be so the mere habit ol assenting is sun oi peril. Still, our
whole argument must tend to show that perception in the Stoic sense is impossible (68).
llowever, a lew words first with Antiochus. When he was converted. what prooi
had be oi tbe doctrine he bad so long denied? (69) Some think be wished to found a
school called by his own name. lt is more probable that he could no longer bear the
opposition oi all other schools to the Academy (70). His conversios gave a splendid
opening lor an offirmtum addentium (71).

βίῃ-56. Part tt oi Cicero's exposition. Reply to Part 1 ol that ol Lucullus.
Yon accuse me ol appealing to ancient mmes like a revolutionist; yet Anaxagoras,
Democritus. aad hietrodoms, philosophers oi the highest position, protest against
the truth oi sense-knowledge, and deny the possibility ol knowledge, altogether
(gr, 73). Empedocles, Xenophanes. and Parmenides all declaim against sense-know·
ledge. Yon sald that Socrates and Plato must not be classed with these. Why?
Socrates said be knew nothing but his own ignorance, while l‘lato pursued the same
theme iu all his works (ῃ). Now do you sce that 1 do not merely name, but take
