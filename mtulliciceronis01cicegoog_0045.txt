28 THE ACADEMICS OF CICERO.

In point of literary execution, no one will doubt that the philo-
sophical treatises of Cicero would compare very favourably with the
works from which they were drawn, if we could put the two sets side
by side¹. In one point, however, the Latin 01 Cicero would be ata
disadvantage even in presence of the Greek of Chrysippus. Greek
possessed a philosophical terminology which, however imperfect, and
however inconsistently applied, was at all events thoroughly familiar
to all cultivated readers Cicero had to create his own terminology in
a language which rebelled against being putto such uses Considering
the enormous difficulties of the task, he may be said to have achieved
it with success He tamed Latin (if the expression be permissible)
to philosophie uses, and started the language on a path in which it
continued to run for ages after Greek philosophy passed away. Few
inventors or adapters of language have exercised an influence so far
reaching².

Very much misconception has prevailed among editors concerning

the relation of the Academico Posteriora to the Academica Pn’ora. Yet
in Cicero's letters the whole matter lies plain to view, and requires
only industry for its perception⁸.

the year 45 ne, Cicero took refuge in the solitude of his villa at Astura,
which was pleasantly situated on the Latin coast between Antium and
Circeii⁴. Here he sought to ease his deep grief by incessant toil He
