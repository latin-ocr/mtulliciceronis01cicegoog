2 THE ACADEMICS OF CICERO.

At this time (i. e. before 88 ac.) Cicero also heard the lectures of
Diodotus the Stoic, with whom he studied chiefly, though not exclu-
sively, the art of dialectic¹. This art, which Cicero deems so important
to the orator that he calls it ‘abbreviated eloquence‚’ was then almost
the monopoly of the Stoic school. For some time Cicero spent all his
days with Diodotus in the⁴ severest study, but he seems not to have been
much attracted by the general Stoic teaching. Still, the friendship
between the two lasted till the death of Diodotus, who, according to a
fashion set by the Roman Stoic circle of the time of Scipio and LaeliuS,
became an inmate of Cicero’s house, where he died in ae. 59, leaving
his pupil heir to a not inconsiderable property'. He seems to have
been one of the most accomplished men of his time, and Cicero's
feelings towards him were those of gratitude, esteem, and admira-
tion³.

In the year'88 ae. the celebrated Philo of Larissa, then head of the
Academic School, came to Rome, one of a number of eminent Greeks
who fied from Athens on the approach of its siege during the Mithri·
datic war. , Philo, like Diodotus, was a man of versatile genius: unlike
the Stoic philosopher, he was a perfect master of both, the theory and
the practice of oratory. Cicero had scarcely heard him before all
inclination for Epicureanism was swept from his mind, and he sur-
rendered himself wholly, as he tells us, to the brilliant Academic⁴.
Smitten with a marvellous enthusiasm he abandoned all other studies
for philosophy. His zeal was quickened by the conviction that the
old judicial system of Rome was overthrown for ever, and that the
great career once open to an orator was now barred ⁵.

We thus see that before Cicero was twenty years of age, he had
been brought into intimate connexion with at least three of the most
eminent philosophers of the day, who represented thc three most
vigorous and important Greek schools. It is fair to conclude that
he must have become thoroughly acquainted with their spirit, and
with the main tenets of each. His own statementS, after every deduc·
tion necessitated by his egotism has been made, leave no doubt about
his diligence as a student. In his later works he often dwells on his
youthful devotion to philosophy⁸. It would be unwise to lay 'too
