(ἦ 307-32. Part lv ol Varro’s exposition: Antiochus’ Logic. Although the old
Academica and Peripatetics based knowledge on the senses, th'ey did not place in the
sesses the criterion ο( truth, but in the mind, because it alone saw the permanently
real and true (30). The senses they thought heavy and clogged and unable togain
knowledge ol snch things as were either too small to come into the domuin ol sense,
or so changing and lieeting that no part ol their being remained constant or even the
same, seeing that all parts were in a continuone llnx. Knowledge based only on sense
was therefore mere opinion (31). Real knowledge only came through the reasonings
ol the mind; hence they desines! everything about which they argued, and also used
etymology, lrom which they drew prools. ln these two processes consisted their
dialectic, to which they added persuasive rhetoric (32).

ὅ 33-42· Part v oi Varro's exposition: the departures from theold Academico·
Peripatetic school. Aristotle crnshed the reta ol Plato; Theophrastus weakened the
power ol virtue (33). Strato abandoned ethics ior physics; Speusippus, Xenocrates,
Polemo, Crates, Crantor laithlnlly kept the old tradition, to which Zenoand Arcesilas,
pupils oi Polemo, were both disloyal (34). Zeno maintained that nothing bnt virtue

could inlinence happiness, and would allow the name good to nothing else (35). All
³ other things he divided into three classes; some were in accordance with nature, some
at discord with nature, and some were neutral. To the first class he assigned a
positive velue and called thern preferred,· to the second a negative valne and
called them rejected ,· to the third no value whatever-mere verbal alterations on
the old scheme (36. ῃ). Thongh the ternas right action aad sin belong only to virtue
andriae, he thought there was an appropriate action (osticium) and an inappro·
priate, which concerned things preferred aad things rejected (37). lle made all
virtue reside in the reason, aad considered not the practice but the mere possession
ol virtue to be the important thing, although the possession could not bnt lead to the
practice (38). All emotion he regarded as nnnaturel and immoral (38, 39h‘ljln physics
hc disoarded the fifth clement, and believed lire to be the universal substance, while he
would not allow the existence ol anything incorporeal (39). In dialectic, he analysed
sensation into two parts, an impulse from without, and a succeeding jndgmeut oi the
mind, in passing which the will was entirely iree (4ο). Sensations (uisa) he divided
into the true and the untnre; ii the examination gone through by the mind proved
irrefragably the tnrth ol a sensation he called it Knewlrdgr5 ii otherwise, meante
(41). Perceptr'orr, thns defined, hc regarded as morally neither right nor wrong, butas
the sole ultimate basis oi truth. Rnlrness in giving assent to phenomena, and all
othegdeiects ia the applicatioa to thern oi the reason, he thought could not coesist
with virtue und perfect wisdom (4²)-

843-de Cicero's historical justificatior ol the New Academy. Arcesilas'
philosophy was dne to no mere passion sor victory in argument, bnt to the obscurity
oi phenomena, which had led the ancients to despair ot' knowledge (44). He
even abandoned* the one tenet held by Socrates to bc certain; and maintained that
since arguments ol εφη( strength could be urged in lavonr ol the truth or lalsehood ol
phenomena, the proper ronne to take was to suspend jndgment entirely (45). llis
vicws were really in harmony with those ol Plato, aad were carried on by Carneades
