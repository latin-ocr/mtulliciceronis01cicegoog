Catulus was followed by Hortensius, who in some way spolie in
favour of Antiochean opinions, but to what extent is uncertain¹. l
think it extremely probable that he gave a resume of the history of phi-
losophy, corresponding to the speech of Varro in the beginning of the
Academico Posteriora. One main reason in favour of this view is the
difficulty of understanding to whom, if not to Hortensius, the substance
of this speech could have been assigned in the first edition In the
Acaderm'ca Posteriora it was necessary to make Varro speak first and not
second as Hortensius did 5 this accounts for the disappearance in the
second edition of a polemical argument advanced by Hortensius¹, which
would be appropriate only in the mouth of one who was ansveringa speech
already made. On the view I have taken, there would be little difficulty
in the fact that Hortensius now advocates a dogmatic philosophy,
though in the lost dialogue which bore his name he had argued against
philosophy altogether³, and denied that philosophy and wisdom were at
all the same thing⁴. Such a historical re'sume as Ι have supposed Hor-
tensius to give would be within the reach of any cultivated man of the
time, and would only be put fonvard to show that the New Academic
revolt against the old AcademicoPeripatetic school, as viewed by
Antiochus, was unjustifrable. There is actual warrant for stating that
¹ the exposition given by Hortensius of Antiochus was merely superficial⁵.

We are thus relieved from the necessity of forcing the meaning of the
words Hortensium nostrum corrtrnoverts⁸, frorn which Krische infers that
the dialogue, entitled Hortensiirs, had ended in a conversion to philo
sophy of the orator from whom it was named. To any such conversion
we have nowhere else any allusion. '

The relation in which Hortensius stood to Cicera, also his character
and attainments, are too well known to need mention here. He seems
to have been as nearly innocent oi any acquaintance with philosophy as
it was possible at the time for an educated nian to be. Cicero's
materials for the speech of Hortensius were, doubtlesS, drawn from the

‚works of Antiochus⁷.

The speech of Hortensius was ansvered by Cicero himself. If my
view of the preceding speech is correct, it follows that Cicero in his
reply pursued the same course which he takes in his answer to Verre,
part of which is preserved in the Academica Posterioro³. He justified
the New Academy by showing that it was in essential harmony with the
