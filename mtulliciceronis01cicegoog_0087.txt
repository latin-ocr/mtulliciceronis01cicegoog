70 THE ACADEMICS OF CICERO.

of the quotations made by Davies shows these collatioris to have been
very imperfect At least Davies often appeals to them on trivial matters
while he says nothing about them when dealing with difficult passages.
In his notes on Acad. I the codex Elisnsr's is quoted ten times only. In
only two of these places has it readings peculiar to itself, via ἓ a ecquid
and5 ²4 nou auditis for inaudito, both evidently conjectures, the frrst
being right, the second wrong. In the notes to the Lucullus the two
rodam are indicated thirtycight times, but in such a careless way that it
is scarcely ever possible to draw distinctions between the two. Only in
one place does he contrast two different readings of the same passage
drawn from the two codices (ἓ ²7 where El abas nonsatis, El. isatis).
In another note (on ἓ 129) he quotes ‘trs Eliensis' in the singular; all the
other references are to ‘omnes nostri' or to ‘Eliens’ without distinction.
In one passage onlya reading is attributed to ‘Eliens’ which is not
found in any other MS, via ferrentur for serentur in 5 94, which, though
adopted by Davies, is decidedly wrong.

Enough has been said to show that so far at least as the Academica
is concemed, the codices Elr'enses are not worthy of serious attention.

e. Conceming the history of criticism as applied to the Academico ¹.
Of the xvth century printed editions the only one of any use for the
study of the text is the Roman edition of 1471. 'l'o two scholars of the
succeeding century it was principally due that the Latin was purged of
the grossest and most superficial errors that had crept into the uss,
The first of these was the Venetian‚ Paulus Manutius, whose edition
(1540-1546) first laid the foundation of a sound text of Cicero's works
He was succeeded by D. Lambinus, who outshone all his predecessore
in knowledge of Latin literature, and particularly of Cicero¹. There
were few weak points in the text on which he did not lay his finger.
But he had two great faults. In the first place he was not content to
try and find out what Cicero did write, but loved to introduce into the
text countless small alterations which he thought improvements, but
which were without evidence to support thern. Also he destroyed ina
great measure the value of his work by disingenuousness in attributing
his own conjectures to russ sources.

To Adrian Turnebus belongs the credit of being the first to advance
the interpretation of the Acodom‘ca by an appeal to the sources of the
ancient philosophy. His commentary on Acad. I was published in

Paris in 1553. That of P. Faber on both books appeared in 1611, and
is remarkable for acute ohservations on the language of the work.
