The next editor who did much to advance the criticism ol the
Academica was John Davies, President os Queens‘ College, Cambridge, .
as a Latin scholar surpassed in his own time by Bentley alone. His
first edition appeared in 1725, his second in ¹73⁶r the latter hasbeen
reprinted by Rath (Halle, 1806). Davies successsully st'udied in other
ancient worlrs the philosophical doctrines discussed in the Academica.
The value oi his work, great in itself, was enhanced by reprintsos the
notes os Victorius, Muretus, Lambinus, Faber and Turnebus, and other
scholars.

An edition by Wetzel (Brunsvvick, 1799) contains t'ew notes, but
they are generally sensible. That by Hillsemann (hlagdeburg 1806)
has a good deal ol usesul illustrative matter.

It is unfortunately necessary to mention the edition ol Goerenz
(leipzig, 1810). The extraordinary vitality os this writers worlrs is a
singular fact in literary history. Before 1826 Goerenz had areputation
sor Latin scholarship which was perhaps not inferior to that of any man
then living. ln that year, however, a small work¹ was published by
Madvig, then barely twenty-one years os age, which shattered lor ever
the pretensions ol Goerenz to the title os scholar, in the eyes at least ol
all those who are qualified and who take pains enough to judge. Yet
a year later Orelli could found his text ol the Acadanr'ca upon the
‘praestantissima receasrh' os Goerenz, though he was well acquainted
with Madvig's little book. Since then Madvig, in his editions ot' the
De finibus, has most mercilessly displayed Goerenz as the ‹lrunlren
Helot of latin scholarship. ln spite os this, the professed guides os
studious youth, occasionally in Germany, but more often in England,
still to this day recommend the editions ol Goerenr, even to the ex·
clusion of all others.

The recension ot' Goerenz was the last which appeared, accompanied
by explanatory notes, until my first edition ot' 1874

Orelli’s critical edition (Zdrich, 1827) is still so uselul, that it deserves
a mention. It gives the readings of many ol the earlier editions, and
although these are not always accurately reported, the information is
very acceptable, when access cannot be had to an extensive library.
Orelli has also reprinted, among other things, the Academica os P.
Valentia (mentioned below), and the work of Augustine, Adrrrsus
Academicos.

's he most valuable translations are those os Boost (Mannhcim, 1816)
who was in many passages the first writer to see the true interpretation,
