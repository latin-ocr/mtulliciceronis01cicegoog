‘¹ hir Reid is so well known to scholars as a commentator on Cicero that a nerr
work from him scarcely needs any commendation of ours. His edition of the speech
Pro Sulla is fully equal in merit to tlte volumes which he has already publiaherl. . .
lt would be diffie-ult to speak too highly of the notes. There could be no better tray
of gaining an insight into the characteristics of Cicero's style and tlte Latini of ltis
period than hy making a careful study of this speech with the aid of Mr Rei s com·
mentary. .. hlr lttrid's intimate knowledge of the ntinutest details of scholanhip
enables him ιο detect and explain the slightest points of distinction between the
tisages of ‹lifferertt authors and different periods. . . The notes are followed by a valu-
ahle appendix on the text, and another on points of orthograpby3 an excellent index
brings the work to a close.”-Saturday Reur'eto.

‘⁸ hir Reid's wide and profound knowledge of his author’s diction rendere him a
particularly sure gttide ιο his meaning, and no intelligent student can read one of his
works without a material strengthentng of his scholarship.. . lt is not too mach te
{lay} that the style of hir Reid's commentaries is now approaching perfection.”-

⁴· It is an admirable specimen of careful editing. An introduction tells tts every·
thing we could wish ιο know about Archias, about Cicero's connexion with him. abottt
the inerits of the trial, and the genuineness of the speech. The text is well and care·
fully printed. The notes are clear and scholar-like. No boy can master this little
volume without feeling that he has advanced a long step in scholarship.”-Actrdenty.

“The hest of them, to our mind, are Mt Reid’s two eolumes containing thePro
Archia lbera and I'ro Btrlhe of Cicero. The introductione, which deal with the cir·
cutttstattces of each s eech. giving also an analysis of its contenta and a criticism of its
nterits, are modeis op clear and concise statement, at once intelligible to junior studente
and useful for those who are more advanced.''-Grtardian.

‘¹ hir Reid's Orations for Archias and for Balbus profess to keep in mind the train-
ing of the student's eye for the finer and more delicate matters of scholarahi no lea
than for the more obvious; and not only deal with the commonplaoe not r‘lt‘a of a
latin oration as they serve tlte needs of a commonplace student, but also point ottt the
specialities of Cicero's subject-matter and modes of expression. . . We are bound ιο
