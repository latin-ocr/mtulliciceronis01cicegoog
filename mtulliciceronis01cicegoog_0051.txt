34 THE ACADEMICS OF CICERO.

was made that the Academica would just suit Varro, who was a follower
of Antiochus and the fittest person to expound the opinions of that
philosopher¹. It happened that continual rain fell during the first few
days of Cicero's stay at Arpinum, so he employed his whole time in
editing afresh the Aradarum, which he now divided into four books
instead of two, making the interlocutors himself, Varro and Atticus&
The position occupied by Atticus in the dialogue was quite second-
ary, but he was so well pleased with it that Cicero determined to
confer on him often in the future such minor parts⁸. Α suggestion
made by Atticus that Cotta should also be introduced was rejected
as impracticable⁴. Although the work of reediting was vigorously
pushed on, Cicero had frequent doubts about the expediency of dedi-
cating the work to Varro. He repeatedly throws upon Atticus the
whole responsibility for the decision, and but for his friend’s impor-
tunities he would probably again have changed his pians. Nearly every
letter written to Atticus during the progress of the work contains en-
treaties that he would consider the matter over and over again before he
finally decided⁵. As no reasons had been given for these solicita-
tions, Atticus naturally grew impanent, and Cicero was obliged to
assure him that there were reasons, which he would disclose when
they met⁰. The true reasons did however appear in some later letters,
In one Cicero said: ‘I am in favour of Varro, and the more so because
he wishes it, but you know he is

δεινός ἀνήρ, τάχα κεν καὶ ἀναίτιον αἰτιόῳτο.

So there often flits before me a vision of his face, as he grumbles‚ it
may be, that my part in the treatise is more fully sustained than his3 a
charge which you will perceive to be untme⁷.' Cicer0, then, feared
Varro's temper and perhaps his knowledge and real critical fastidious·
