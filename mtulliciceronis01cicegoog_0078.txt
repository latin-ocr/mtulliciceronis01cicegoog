of the new sceptic school is summed up in the extant writings of Sextus
Empiricus, who lived in the third century of our era¹. As the later
sceptics made full use of the literature of the New Academy, Sextus is
of prime importance for the elucidation of the Academica. He was an
admitted master of the sceptical philosophy, and his exposition of it is
thorough and relentless. It will be of use to set side by side the corn·
paratively loose assault made by Clitomachus upon the dogmatists‚ and
the far more highly organised attack which we find in Sextus. For
this purpose, we will first take the ten ‘methods' of Aenesidemus, and
show to what extent they have their counterparts in the Academica.

The first ‘method'’ shows that as animals are differently constituted
the impressions which objects make on their senses must be different,
and therefore the evidence of sense is contradictory. This is only just
touched upon in the Acadcmt'ca'. Next comes the ‘method' which is
based on the differences of constitution found among human beings, in
respect both of the bodily and of the intellectual powers⁴. Under this
head falls that discordance of opinion among the dogmatista which has
supplied so many weapons for the sceptic armoirry in all ages. A large
portion of the Academica is devoted to this subject⁶, while a few argu-
ments are also based on the physical diversities existing among men⁶.
Thirdly, the sceptic urged that most objects make separate and even
contradictory impressions on two or more of the senses; it is impossible
to say whether the object is possessed of one quality only, which is
differentiated by our semes, or whether it possesses just so many quali·
ties as our senses perceive‚ or whether it has other qualities which we
could not perceive without the addition of other senses⁷. In the Aco-
demica these arguments are only just hinted⁸. The fourth τρόπος is
derived from the difference of inipression which the same object makes
on the senses under different bodily conditions, for example, in sickness
and in health⁹. This point is urged at some length in the portion of
the Academica which we possess, and probably had some space devoted
to it in the part which has been lost¹⁰. The fifth ‘method’ carries the
preceding contentiori a step farther and shows how the impressions
