10 THE ACADEMICS OF CICERO.

us so much of the later Greek speculation, which isos vast historical
value and was doomed to perish in the original Greek I shall speak
hereafter of some causes which have contributed to produce a low esti·
mate of Cicero’s work. But there is one piece of unfairness which I
shall have no better opportunity of mentioning than the present It
is this. Cicero, the philosopher, is made to suffer for the short·
comings of Cicero the politician. Scholars who have learned to despise
his politieal weakness, vanity, and irresolution, make haste to depre-
ciate his achievements in philosophy, without troubling themselves to
inquire too closely into their intrinsic value. From political partisan·
ship, and prejudices based on facts irrelevant to the matter in hand,
1 beg all students to free themselves in reading the Academica.

§a The Pln'losopdical Optiu'ons os Cicero.

In the time of Cicero students of philosophy nearly all belonged
to one of two opposing camps. The Stoic and the Epicurean systems
each had a large following. The Peripatetic sect numbered buta few
adherents¹. The New Academy had only at three periods in its history
attracted to 'it any large number of disciples‚ once when it was founded
by Arcesilas, again under the presidency of Carneadea and lastly
when Philo was at its head. Philo himself at the end of his life
ceased to preach the pure doctrine of Carneades, and when he died
the New Academy practically became extinct ¹. Meanwhile, Philo's
‘pupil, Antiochus, had constructed a combination of Stoicism, Plato
nism‚ and Peripateticism, which he dignified by the name of the Old
Academy, and for which he secured some support. Of this system it
will be necessary to speak hereafter.

In attempting to detine Cicero’s position with respect to the
various contemporary schools of thought, it will be best to follow the

division of philosophy (recognised by all the post-Aristotelian teachers),
into the three branches of Logic, Ethics, Physics'. For the moment

we may put aside the last-named branch. The only post-Aristotelian
school which possessed a system of physics in all respects peculiar to
itself was the Epicuream, and physical arguments were not prominent
in the controversies of the time The two main tasks of the later
