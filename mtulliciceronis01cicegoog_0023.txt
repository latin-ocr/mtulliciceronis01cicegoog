when he was working his hardest for the consulship, his beart was
given to the adomment of his Tusculan villa in a way suited to his
literary and philosophie tastes. This may be taken as a specimen
of his spirit throughout his life He was before all things a man of
letters 3 compared with literature, politics and oratory held quite a
secondary place iu his affections. Public business employed his in·
tellect‚ but never his heart.

The year 62 released him from the consulship and enabled him
to indulge his literary tastes To this year belong the publication of
his speeches, which were crowded, he says, with the maxims of philo
sophy¹ 3 the history of his consulship, iu Latin and Greek, the Greek
version which he sent to Posidonius being modelled on Isocrates and
Aristotle ; and the poem on his consulship, of which some fragments
remain. A year or two later we find him reading with enthusiasm the
works of Dicaearchus, and keepiug up his acquaintance with living
Greek philosophers⁸. His long lack of leisure seems to have caused ·

, an almost unquenchable thirst for reading at this time. His friend

Paetus had inherited a valuable library, which he presented to Cicero.
It was in Greece at the time, and Cicero thus writes to Atticus: ‘If
you love me and feel sure of my love for you, use all the endeavours
of your friends, clients, acquaintances, freedmen, and even slaves to
prevent a single leaf from being lost...Every day 1 find greater satis-
faction in study‚ so far as my forensic labours permit⁸.’ At this period
of his life Cicero spent much time in study at his estates near Tusculum,
Antium, Formiae, and elsewhere. 1 dwell with greater emphasis on
these facts, because of the idea now spread abroad that Cicero was
amere dabbler in literature, and that his works were extemporepara·
phrases of Greek books half understood In truth, his appetite for
every kind of literature was insatiable, and his attainments in each
department considerable He was certainly the most learned Roman
of his age, with the single exception of Varro. One of his letters to
Atticus⁴ will give a fair picture of his life at this time. He especially
studied the political writings of the Greeks, such as Theophrastus and
Dicaearchus⁶. He also wrote historical memoirs after the fashion of
'l‘heopompus‘.

The years from 59—57 rac were years in which Cicero’s private
cares overwhelmed all thought of other occupatiori. Soon after his
” retum from exile, in the year 56, he describes himself as ‘devouring
