40 THE ACADEMICS OF CICERO.

one voice ‘On you¹.' He alone was bold enough to rebuke the follies,
on the one hand, of the mob, on the other, of the senate'. No storrn
of danger, no favonring breeze of fortune, could ever inspire in him either
fear or hope, or cause him to swerve from his own course¹. His influence,
though he be dead, will ever live among his countrymen⁴. He was not
only glorious in his life, but fortunate in his death⁶.

Apart from Cicero's general agreement with Catulus in politics, there
were special causes for his enthusiasm. Catulus was one of the uiri con-
salares who had given their unreserved approval to the measures taken
for the suppression of the Catilinarian conspiracy, and was the first to
confer on Cicero the greatest glory of his life, the title ‘father of his
country⁶.' So closely did Cicero suppose himself to be allied to Catulus,
that a friend tried to console him for the death of Tullia, by bidding him
remember ‘Catulus and the olden times⁷.' Τὴε statement of Catulus,
often referred to by Cicero, that Rome had never been so unfortunate
as to have two bad consuls in the same year, except when Cinna held
the office, was intended to point a contrast between the zeal of Cicero
and the lukewarmness of his colleague Antonius⁸. Archias, who

engaged to write a poem in honour of Cicero's consulship, lived in the
house of the two Catuli⁹.

We have seen that when Cicero found it too late to withdraw the

first edition of the Acadernt'ca from circulation, he affixed a prooemium to
each book, Catulus being lauded in the first, Lucullus in the second.

From the passages above quoted, and from our knowledge of Cicero’s
habit in such matters, we can have no difficulty in conjecturing at least a
portion of the contents of the lost prooemium to the Catulus. The
achievements of the elder Catulus were probably extolled, as wellas
those of his son. The philosophical knowledge of the elder man was
made to cast its lustre on the younger. Cicero's glorious consulship
was once more lauded, and great strcss was laid upon the patronage it
received from so famous a man as the younger Catulus, whose praises
were sung in the fervid language which Cicero lavishes on the same
theme elsewhere. Some allusion most likely was made to the con-
nexion of Archias with the Catuli, and to the poem he had promised to
write in Cicero's honour. Then the occasion os the dialogue, its sup
