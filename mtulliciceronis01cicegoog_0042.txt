claims as his own is the style in which they are rendered Such
additions as he made to the originals were prescribed by two require·
ments, first the form into which the works were thrown-always that of
the dialogue-secondly, the interests of Roman readers, for whom
episodes and illustrations from the history and literature of their own
country were introduced. To speak of the latter class of additions first,
it must be remembered that, in the eyes of the average Roman, philo·
sophy iu itself lacked dignity¹, and could only be attractive when set in
a Roman frarne. ¹

All Cicero's philosophical works are written in the form oi dia·
logues; but the dialogue was of the later Greek type, and not of the
kind with which we are so familiar from the works of Plato. This form
seems to have died with Plato The later form was much less dra-
matie, contained much less of question and answer and of repartee, and .
much more of continuous exposition The conversation between the
characters was contined to afew episodes, and the various conflicting
views of the subject discussed were delivered in uninterrupted, or
scarcely interrupted speeches of considerable length¹.

Cicero himself mentions two styles of dialogue which he followed,
that of Heraclides, who introduced as dramatis personae famous men
of a bygone time, and that of Aristotle, who always appeared himself
asan interlocutor in his dialogues, and played the leading part³. He
mentions the De re publr‘ca as Heraclidean, and to the same class
belong the latitia and the Cato Maior. As Aristotelian he mentions
the worlrs he was engaged upon in or about the year 4 5 nef, mean·
ing the Academica and Dc Finibus, and probably the Hortensius,-
though to the same category belong all Cicero's dialogues, with the
exception of the three mentioned above, and perhaps the De Oratore.
About this work Cicero’s language is inconsistent. In one passage
(Att. xur. 19, 4) he implies that he regards it as written after the
fashion of Heraclides. ln another (Fam. 1. 9, 23) he says it is written
‘Aristotelio more! But according to the delinition given in the
