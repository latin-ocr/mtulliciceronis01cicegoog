1 conjecture that Cicero here depended mainly on a work of Clitomachus
mentioned by Diogenes Laertius, which probably contained a critical
history os philosophy¹. ln the course of his remarks Cicero uses a
small fragment ol a lost dialogue by Aristotle'. The only allusions to
other philosophers in the later part os Cicero's speech in the Lnullns
’ are such as to conlirm the suppositiou that it was almost wholly derived
from Clitomachus⁸. ·
Our analysis os the subject-matter os the Academica leads therefore
to the following conclusion. It was composed of two long fragments ot
Antiochus taken from different works, two of Philo from the same
work, four ot Clitomachus from three or four different works. No
attempt was made to recast or rearrange the subJectmatter. lt is to
the last degree improbable that Cicero even condensed or made
omissions to any considerable extent He merely set the fragments
in the tramework os the dialogue. The local scenery, the illustrations
from Roman history and the connecting links‚ constitute all that is due
to his own invention. So lar as philosophy is concemed‚ the passages
which Cicero supplies contain nothing which was not notorious and
well known to every man os culture in his day. In estimating, there·
fore, the philosophical value os the whole work, the reader must put
Cicero’s personality almost entirely out os sight, and look beyond him
to Clitomachus, Philo and Antiochus The only question personal to
Cicero which can arise touches his fidelity as a translator. Few possess,
lew have ever possessed, the peculiar learning which would eutitle them
to prouounce an opinion on this subject I have already stated the
conclusions conceming it to which my studies have led me‘.

There is uo ancient philosophical work which ought to be os greater
interest to modern students of philosophy, and particularly to English
students, than the Academica. The problem it discusses is being de·
bated as vigorously in the philosophical schools today as it was iu the
Ciceronian age The question concems the bases ol human knowledge
and the possibility ol arriwing at certitudo. ln order to a proper un-
derstanding ol the Academico, it is necessary to apprehend in a general
