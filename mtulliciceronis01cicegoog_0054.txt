had already got into Varro’s hands, as we learn lrorn a letter in which
Cicero begs Atticus to ask Varro to make some alterations in his copy
ol the Academica, at a time when the late os the second edition was still
undecided¹. From this laet we may conclude that Cicero had given up
all hope of suppressing the first edition. Indeed he never betrays in
bis letters to Atticus any anxiety that it should be suppressed. He
does, it is true, console Atticus lor the labour lost in copying the first
editione but he assumes that Atticus wlll preler to have the ‘splendidiora
breuiora, meliora⁸.' Still, on every occasion which offered, the author
sought to point out as his authorised edition the one in lour books
He did so in a passage written immediately alter the Academica Parte
riara was completed⁴; and often subsequently, when he most markedly
mentioned the number ol the books as lour⁵. That he wished the work
to bear the title Academica is clear⁰. The expressions Ἀκαδημικῆ
σύνταξις7 and Academia· are merely descriptive‚ so also is the
frequent appellation Academici le‘bre'. The title Academicae Quare
trenes found in many editions is a misnomer. It is an imitation ol‘ the
title Tusculanae Quaestioncs, and was supported by the false notior,
current as early as the time of the elder Pliny, that Cicero had a villa
near Puteoli called ‘Academia’ at which the book was written and from
which it took its name, just as the later book took its name from
the villa at Tusculum¹⁰. The Academica was, however, as we have
