- 36 THE ACADEMICS OF CICERO.

tulos libros¹.’ The binding and adommeut of the presentation copy for
Varro received great attention, and the letter accompanying it was
highly elaborated’. Yet after everything had been done and the book ·
had been sent to Atticus at Rome, Cicero was still uneasy about the
reception it would meet with from Varro. He wrote thus to Atticus:
‘I tell you again and again that the presentation will be at your own
risk. So if you begin to hesitate, let us desert to Brutus, who also is a
follower ol Antiochus. O Academy on the wing, as ever, flitting now
hither, now thither³l' Atticus on his part ‘shuddered’ at the idea of
taking the responsibility⁴. After the work had passed into his hands
Cicero begged him to take all precautions to prevent it from getting into
circulation until the two could meet, and decide its fate. The warning
was necessary, because two persons Balbus and Caerellia, had just
managed to copy Cicero’s rus ol the DcFim‘bus'. In a letter, written
apparently a day or two later, Cicero again declared his intention of
meeting Atticus at Rome, and of then sending the work to Varro it it
should be deemed advisable to do so‘. The meeting ultimately did not
take place, aud Cicero left the four books in Atticus' power, promising
to approve any course that might be taken ⁷. Atticus wrote to say that
as soon as Varro came to Rome the books should be sent to him. ‘By
this time then,' says Cicero when he gets the letter, ‘you have taken the
fatal step ; ah! if you only knew at what peril to yourselfl Perhaps my
letter stopped you, though you had not read it when you wrote. 1 long
to hear how the matter stands⁸.' Again‚ a little later: ‘Yon have been
bold enough, then, to give Varro the books? Iawait his judgment
upon them, but when will he read them⁹?’' Varro probably received
the gift in the first fortnight of August, 45 ac, when Cicero was already
hard at work on the TusarlanDriputatrbns¹⁰. A copy of the first edition
