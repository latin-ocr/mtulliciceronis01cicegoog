52 THE ACADEMICS OF CICERO.

ment is only a literary device No one cau read the speech of Lucullus
without perceiving that Cicero wrote it with aGreek work lying open
before him, from which almost every sentence has been directly trans
ferred. This book was in all probability the Sosus, a dialogue in which
Antiochus attacked the views of his old teacher Philo¹. The terms in

- which Cicero speaks of it show that it covered exactly the same ground

as the discussions which Lucullus professes to report. The Sosus was
probably divided into several books, one of them containinga purely
personal attack upon Philo, which Cicero passed over in writing the

Academr‘cu'.

The sources of the sceptical arguments in the Academica are scarcely
less clear. A work of Philo, twice mentioned, though not by any definite
title³, supplied Cicero with the historical justification of the New Academy
which, in the first edition, he opposed to the speech of Hortensius, and
in the second to that of Varro⁴. From the same work, in all probability, ¹
carne the historical references placed at the outset os Cicero‘s speech iu

the luudlus⁵. It is not quite so easy to trace to their origin the argu-
ments by which Cicero showed the delusive nature of sense-knowledge.
They were common-places of debate used by all philosophical sceptics
from Pyrrho to Sextus. It is more probable that they were here bor-
rowed from Clitomachus than from any otherwriter⁶. The ‘four heads’
of the sceptic argument, which Cicero in his later speech mentions in
close connexion with the criticism directed in his earlier speech against
the semes, are entirely in the style of Clitomachus⁷. The same book
undoubtedly supplied Cicero with the more elaborate criticism on the
bases of knowledge which he embodied in his second speech⁸. Tradition
has, however, only handed down to us the titles o'f a few of the four
hundred books which Clitomachus is said to have written, and no one
of these titles suits the circumstances of the present case.

Cicero next gives two extracts relating to the constructive side of
Carneades' philosophy, taken from two works of Clitomachus which
he names⁹. The rest of his speech in the Lucullus is devoted toan ex·
hibition of the hopeless discord which the history of philosophy presents.
