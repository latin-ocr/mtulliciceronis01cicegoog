Pyrrho and Arcesilas had maintained that all we can do is to act upon
phenomena without attempting to determine their truth or falsehood.
Carneades, equally holding that certainty is a chimera, contended that
reason could lead up to sundry approximations to certainty, which were
the proper bases for action.

The question whether action was possible without certainty was
much talked oi by the disputants‚ but the debate on this topic amounted
in essence to nothing but assertion and denial. The dogmatists affirmed
that ii the sceptics were consistent they would be reduced to inaction
oi every description. The dogmatic position may be here stated in the
words os Hume¹. ‘A Pyrrhonian cannot expect that his philosophy
will have any constant influence, or is it had that its influence would'be
beneficial to society. On the contrary, he must aclmowledge‚ is he
will acknowledge anything, that all human lise must perish, were his
principles universally and steadily to prevail. All discourse‚ all action
would immediately cease‚ and men remain in a total lethargy, till the
necessities of nature, unsatisfied, put an end to their miserable existence.
It is true so [atat an event is very little to be dreaded. Nature is always
too strong for principle, and though a Pyrrhonian may throw himself
and others into a momentary confusion by his profound reasonings, the
first and most trivial event in life will put to flight all his doubts and
scruples and leave him the same in every point of action and specula-
tion with the philosophers oi every other sect, or with those who never
concemed themselves with any philosophical arguments or researches!

The sceptics on the other hand maintained that there was no
inconsistency in their acting and speaking like other men, provided it
were understood that their speech or action was not to be taken as
implying a belief in the correctness oi impressions. They entrenched
themselves in their impregnable position, which may also be described ·
by quoting Hume'. ‘By what argument can it be proved that the per-
ceptions ol the mind must be caused by extemal objects entirely differ-
ent from them, though resembling themi... lt isa question of fact
whether the perceptions oi the senses be produced by external objects
resembling them. How shall this question be determined? By experi-
ence surely as all other questions of a like nature But here experience
is and must be entirely silent. The mind has never anything present to
'it but the perceptions and cannot possibly reach any' experience os their
connexion with objects. The supposition of such a connexion is there·
fore without any foundation in reasoning.'
