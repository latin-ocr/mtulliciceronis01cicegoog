Ol the works on ancient philosophy earlier than our own time, the
Academica of Petrus Valentia (1596) is ol lar the greatest importance lor
the study os the Ciceronian Academica. This writer had acquireda
knowledge ol the post-Aristotelian philosophy which remained unsur·
passed till recent days His work was reprinted by Durand (London,
1740) and by Orelli (1827, see above). A diligent use ol P. Valentia
would have saved succeeding editors from innumerable errors. Α worlr
of the same class, though inferior in merit, is that of Castillon ‘Livres
Academiques de Cice‘ron' (Berlin, 1779) which is accompanied bya
translation.

Os modern writers, Zeller surpasses in usesulness all others, although
it must be admitted that his account ol the post-Aristotelian philosophy
is the weakest portion ol his great work

My one aim in this respect has been, by combining and studying the
existing evidence ol all kinds, to arrive as nearly as possible at the
orthography which Cicero actually used. lt would however have been
impossible, without encumbering the notes, to give, except in a lew
instances, the reasons which have induced me to accept certain modes
ol spelling, and to reject others. It is common in this country to find
all attempts at relorming Latin orthography opposed by the argument
from convenience. Ι am convinced that the spelling which rests on the
soundest scientific basis will in the end be found more convenient than
any other. Latin orthography, so lar as printed texts are concemed‚ is
now in a state ol absolute chaos. Something might indeed be said in
favour ol aconsistent conventional spelling to be applied to the whole
ol Latin literature from first to last. But scholarrnever have agreed and
never can agree on any conventional scheme, and were agreement
