posed date, and the place where it was held, were indicated. The place
was the Cumaean villa of Catulus¹. The feigned date must fall between
the year 60 ac. in which Catulus died, and 63, the year of Cicero’s con·
sulship, which is alluded to in the Lucullus⁹. It is well known that in
the arrangement of his dialogues Cicero took every precaution against
anachronisms⁸.

The prooemium ended, the dialogue commenced. Allusion was
undoubtedly made to the Hortensius, in which the same speakers had
been engaged3 and after more compliments had been bandied about,
most of which would fall to Cicero's share, a proposal was made to dis
euss the great difference between the dggmaticand the sceptic schools
Catulus offered to give his lather’s views, at tlre same time commending
lris father’s knowledge ol philosophy. Before we proceed to construet
in outline the speech of Catulus from indications offered by the lucullus,
it is necessary to say something of the character and philosophieal
opinions of Catulus the elder.

In the many passages where Cicero speaks of him, he seldom omits
to mention his sapientia, which implies a certain knowledge of philoso-
phy. He was, says Cicero, the kindest, the most upright‚ the wisest,
the purest ol men⁴. He was a man of universal merit, ol surpassing
worth, a second Laelius⁸. It is easy to gather from the Dc Oratore, in
which he appears as an interlocutor, a more detailed view of his accom-
plishments. Throughout the second and third books heis treated as
the lettered man, par excellence, of the company⁸. Appeal is made to
him when any question is started which touches on Greek literature and
philosophy. We are especially told that even with Greeks his acquaint-
ance with Greek, and his style ol speaking it, won admiration⁷. He
defends the Greeks from the attacks of Crassus⁸. He contemptuously
contrasts the Latin historians with the Greek⁹. He depreciates the
later Greek rhetorical teaching‚ while he bestows high commendation ou
the early sophists¹⁰. The systematic rhetoric of Aristotle and Theophras
tus is most to his mind¹¹. An account is given by him of the history ol
Greek speculation in Italy¹'. The undefiled purity ol his Latin style
made him seem to many the only true speaker of the language¹'. He
