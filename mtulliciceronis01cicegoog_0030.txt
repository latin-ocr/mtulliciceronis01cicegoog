INTRODUCTION. 13

than to discover truth, the fault lies in the nature of things, and not in
him ¹. The New Academy at all times dwelt much on the critical and
destructive side of the Socratic and Platonic teachings⁸. It inter-
preted the constructive dialogues of Plato by the light of the ‘dia
logues of search,’ and maintained that the founder of the Academy
never dreamed of setting forth his doctrines as anything more than
attempts to find the truth. This view of Plato's dialogues seems to
have been pretty widely accepted in Cicero's time, even by dogmatic
'teachers'.

While rejoicing in this boundless freedom of thought, Cicero indig-
nantly repels the charge that the Academy‚ though claiming to seek
for the truth, effaces the distinction between the true and the false,
and can therefore find no truth to follow⁴. Truth is identified with
probability and not with certainty⁵.

Another consideration which attracted Cicero to these tenets was
their evident adaptability to the purposes of oratory,·and the fact that
eloquence was, as he puts it, the child of the Academy⁶. Orators,
politicians, and men of letters had ever found their best nourishment in
the teaching of the Academic and Peripatetic masters⁷, while the Stoics
and Epicureans cared nothing for power of expression. Again, the
Academic tenets were those with which the common sense of the world
was most in sympathy'. The Academy moreover was the school which
had the most respectable pedigree Philo was the successor, in a
direct line, of Socrates and Plato. All other systems, which could not ‘
trace their origin to these philosophers, had a plebeian appearance’.
The philosopher who best preserved the Socratic tradition was most
estimable, ceteris parabus, and that philosopher was Carneades¹⁰, whom
Philo unhesitatingly followed at the time when Cicero heard him.

Before we proceed to state the ethical views of Cicero, it will be
convenient to discuss one or two matters which concern his entire
attitude with regard to philosophy. Though he described himself
asa New Academic, he has in modern times far oftener been named
