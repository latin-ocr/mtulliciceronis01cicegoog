80 THE ACADEMICS OF CICERO.

for my models famous ment Even Chrysippus stated many difficulties concerning
the senses and general experience. l'ou say he solved them; even if he did, whlch
1 do not believe, he admitted that it was not easy to escape being ensnared by them
(75). The Cyrenaics too held that they knew nothing about things externat to them·
selvesfy6).

§576—78. Part ttt of Cicero’s exposition The issue between scepticism and
dogmatism defined. The sincetity of Arcesilas may be seen thus (76). Zeno held
strongly that the wise man ought to¹ keep clear from opinion. Arcesilas agreedz but
this without knoruledge was impossible. Knmoledge consists of perception& Arcesilas

' therefore demanded a definition of percepturi. This definition Arcesilas combated.
This is the controversy which has lasted to our time. Do away with opinion and
’ perception, and the έποχὴ of Arcesilas follows at once (ῃ, 78).

§579-90. Part tv of Cicero’s exposition. The uncertainty of sense-knowledge
demonstrated. You are wrong, Lucullus, in upholding your cause in spite of my argu-
ments yesterday against the senses. l'ou are thus acting like the Epicuream, who
say that the inference only from the sensation ean be false, not the sensation itself
(79, 8ο). 1 wish the god of whom you spoke would ask me whether 1 wanted any·
thing more than sound senses He would have a bad time with me. For even
granting that our visionis correct, how marvellously circumscribed it is! But, say
you, we desire no more. No, 1 answer, you are like the mole, who desires not the
light besam he is blind. Yet l would not so much reproach the god because my

’ vision is narrow,asbecause it deceives me (80, 81). If you want something greater
than the bent oar, what can be greater than the sun? Still he seems to us a foot
broad, and Epicurus thinks he may be a little broader or narrower than he seems.
With all his enormous speed, too, he appears to us to stand still (8ο). The whole
question lies in a nul-shell: of four propositions which prove my point only one is
disputed, viz. that every true sensation has side by side with it a false one indistinguish·
able from it (83). A man who has mistaken Ρ. for Q. Geminus could have no infal-
lible mode of recognising Cotta. lfou say that no such indistinguishable resemblances
exist. Never mind; they seem to exist and that is enough. One mistalren sensation
will throw all the others into uncertainty (84). You say everything belongs to its own
genua· this 1 will not contest. 1 am not concemed to show that two sensations cre
absolutely similar ; it is enough that human faculties cannot distinguish between them.
How about the impressions of signet-rings? (85) Can you lind a ring-merchant to
rival your chicken·rearer of Delos? But, you say, art aids the senses. So we cannot
see or hear without art, which so few can have! What an idea this gives us of the
art with which nature has constructed the senses! (86) But about physics l will
speak afterwards. 1 am going now to advance against the seuses arguments drawn
from Chrysippus himself (87). You said that the sensations of dreamers, drunkards
and madmen were feebler thau those of the waking, the sober and the saue. The
cases of Ennius and his Alcmaeon, of your own relative Tuditanus, of the Hercules of
Euripides, dlsprove your point (88, 89). In their case at least 'mind aad eyes
agreed-¹ It is of no use to talk about the saner momeuts of such people; the question
is, what was the nature of their sensations at the time they were affected? (90)

§gor-98. Part vof Cicero’sexpositiou. Dialectic cannot lead up to certainty.
Dialectic cannot lead to stable knowledge; its processes are not applicable to a
large number of philosophica! questions (91). You value the art, bttt please re·
member that it gave rise to fallacieslilre the sorites, which you say is faulty (9²)· If>
it is so, refute it. The plan of Chrysippus, to refrain from answering, will avail you
