INTRODUCTION. 2 3

ln his enforced political inaction and amid the disorganisation oi the
law courts, it was only by such work that he could render any service
at all¹. He iswithin his right when he claims praise for not abandoning
himself to idleness or worse, as did so many ol the most prominent
men os his time¹. For Cicero, idleness was at all times misery, and

in those evil days he was spurred on to exertion by the deepest sorrow³.
Philosophy took sor him the place of sorensic oratory, public harangues
and politics⁴. It is strange to find Cicero making such elaborate
apologies sor devoting himself to the study os philosophy, and a careless ·
reader might set them down to egotism. But it must never be sorgotten
that at Rome all literary and artistic pursuits were merely the amusement
os the wealthy 3 the total devotion of a lise to them seemed well enough
ior Greeks, but sor Romans unmanly and unpractical⁵. Politics, oratory
and war were the only worthy liselong occupations for the Romans
ol' wealth and ability. There were plenty os Romans, even in Cicero’s
time, ready to condemn literature and art altogether, as effeminate
inventions os the Greeks. Some, while not objecting to other forms
oi literature, despised philosophy, and thought any Roman statesman
degreded who meddled with it⁰. OtherS, like the Neoptolemus os
Ennius, thought a little learning in philosophy was good, but that a
great deal os it was a dangerous thing⁷. Some few preferred that
Cicero should write on other subjects⁸. To these he replies by urging
the pressing necessity there was lor works in Latin on philosophy.

Still, amid much depreciation, sufficient interest and sympathy
were roused by his first philosophical works to encourage Cicero to
proceed The elder generatim, sor whose approbation he most cared,

praised the books, and many were induced both to read and to write
works on philosophy⁹. Cicero now extended his plan, which was at tirst
only tentative, so as to bring within its scope every topic which Greek
philosophers were accustomed to treat¹⁰. Separate topics in philosophy
