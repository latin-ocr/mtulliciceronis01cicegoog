24 THE ACADEMICS OF CICERO.

could not be thoroughly understood till the whole subject had been
mastered¹. This design then, which is not explicitly stated in the
two earliest works which we possess, the Academico and De manus,
required the composition of a sort of philosophical encyclopaedia.
In accordance with Greek precedent, Cicero claimed to have his books
on rhetoric and politics, nearly all of them published before the writings
which belong to philosophy in the modern sense, included in the circle
of his philosophical works¹. It is no part of my plan to enumerate
or characterise these writings separately. 1 cau only speak of the
leading features of the whole group, and in detail of the Academico
and one or two works more or less closely connected with it

It wlll be necessary now to consider the method on which Cicero
constructed his philosophical treatises As we have seen, he made
no claim to originality. He did not even suppose himself to possess a
special and technical knowledge of what had been written on the
subject ³. His early education, however, and subsequent reading had
given him a good general acquaintance with the principles of the post·
Aristotelian schools which he desired to explain to his fellowcountry·
men But he never ventured to set forth those principles according to
any fashion or arrangement of his own. His books are in no sense
compilatione from a number of different sources. When he wished to
set before his readers the view taken by any school about any par·
ticular topic, he selected some one work relating to it, by an acknow-
ledged master of the school. This he kept to very closely indeed ;
his writings are, in fact, to a great extent translations, though free
translations, from the Greek sources. In no other way could the
enormous mass of literature, which he poured forth in the last few
years of his life, have been producent He constructed his philoso
phical works very much in the manner after which Livy constructed his
history. Cicero took no pains to conceal the comparatively humble
rote which he proposed to himself. Frequently, indeed generally, he
indicates the Greek works on which he draws. What he specially
