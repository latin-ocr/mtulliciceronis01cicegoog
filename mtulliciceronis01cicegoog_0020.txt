INTRODUCTION. 3

much stress on the close relation which subsisted between the rhetorical
and the ethical teaching of the Greeks, but there can be little doubt
that from the great rhetorician Molo, at this time Rhodian ambassador
at Rome, Cicero gained valuable information concerning the ethical
part of the Greek philosophy.

During the years 88—81 n. c. Cicero employed himself incessantly
with the pursuit of philosophy, law, rhetoric, and belles lettres. Many
ambitious works in the two departments last mentioned were written by
him at this period. On Sulla's return to the city after his conquest
of the Marian party in Italy, judicial affairs once more took their
regular course, and Cicero appeared as a pleader in the courts, the one
philosophie orator of Rome, as he not unjustly boasts¹. For two years
he was busily engaged, and then suddenly lett Rome for a tour in
Eastern Hellas. It is usually supposed that he came into collision
with Sulla through the freedman Chrysogonus, who was implicated
in the case of Roscius 'she silence of Cicero is enough to condemn
this theory, which rests on no better evidence than that of Plutarch.
Cicero himself, even when mentioning his speech in defence of Roscius,
never assigns any other cause for his departure¹ than his health, which
was being undermined by his passionate style of oratory¹.

The whole two years 79-77 rac. were spent in the society of Greek
philosophers and rhetoricians. The frrst six months were passed at
Athens, and were almost entirely devoted to philosophy, since, with the
exception of Demetrius Syrus, there were no eminent rhetorical teachers
at that time resident in the city⁸. Probably by the advice of Philo
himself ⁴, Cicero attended the lectures of that clear thinker and writer, as
Diogenes Laertius calls him⁵, Zeno of Sidon, now the coryphaeus (so
Philo entitled him) of the Epicurean school. In Cicero's later works
there are several references to his teaching. He was biting and sarcastic
in speech, and spiteful in spirit, hence in striking contrast to Patro aud
Phaedrus‘. lt is curious to find that Zeno is numbered by Cicero
among those pupils aud admirers of Carneades whom he had known'.
Phaedrus was now at Athens, and along with Atticus, who loved Phae-
drus beyond all other philosophers', Cicero spent much time in listening
to his instruction, which was eagerly discussed by the two pupils’.
Patro was probably in Athens at the same time, but this is nowhere
