INTRODUCTIOM 57

Hume and many other writers since have pronouneed these sceptical
arguments to be unanswerable. Modern philosophers have in fact been
able to supply to the question ‘why should we believe any impression
of sense to give a correct picture of the object which causes itt’ no
better answer than that of the Stoics ‘because in some cases our minds
feel convinced of the correctness of the impression, in others not'

b. Philo and Antiochus.

⁴The opinions of these philosophers will only here be discussed so
far as they concern the main problem of the Academt'ca'. Both Philo
and Antiochus began their teaching as ardent defendens of the pure
doctrine of Carneades¹. Both in their later days promoted‚ indifferent
degrees, a reaction towards dogmatic doctrines. In the case of Antio·
chus this reaction was complete. So far as dialectic was concerned‚ he
wholly attached himself to the Stoic school. In ethics and natural
science he also accepted much from Zeno and Chrysippus, while de· ,
claring that these philosophers had horrowed their teaching from Plato
and Aristotle and their immediate followers⁸. In Philo’s case the nature of
the reaction is exceedingly difficult to trace. All the information about
it which we possess consists of a few hints in the Academica and two or
three passages in other writers. Philo it is certain at all times main-
tained in its full force the whole polemic conducted by Carneades
against the Stoic definition of the ‘irresistible impression⁴.' Yet he
contended that things are in their own nature knowable⁵. But none of
the sceptics or New Academics had ever asserted that our lach of sure
knowledge is due to the nature of the objects os cognition. They re-
ferred it entirely to the defecta in our faculties of perception. We want
to be told, therefore, hotv Philo supposed it possible to arrive at a know·
ledge of things. Unfortunately no ancient authority has preserved for
us any information on this point, and we are reduced to founding con-
