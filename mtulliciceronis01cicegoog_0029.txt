12 THE ACADEMICS OF CICERO.

13 positiveness of assertion there seemed to Cicero to be something

’ reckless ancl unseemly, 3ηά destructive of that dignity, balance, and

control which distinguish the Roman ideal of character¹. He fre
quently urges arguments also, which have had countless parallels in
modern timeS, to show that the untrammelled conflict of opinionis
necessary to the progress of thought To freedom of speculation
Greece owed the pre-eminence of her philosophers'. Wherever autho
rity had loudly raised its voice, there philosophy had pined. Pytha-
goras is quoted³ as a warning example, and the baneful effects of
authority are often depicted‘. The true philosophie spirit, Cicero said,
requires us not to maintain with obstinacy one view of a subject, but to
study all views. It is a matter of duty to discuss all aspects of every
question, after the example of the Old Academy (tie. the immediate
suecessors of Plato and of Aristotle⁵). Those who demand strict dog-
matic formulas are mere busybodies⁸. The Academics glory in their
freedom of judgment. They are not compelled to defend 33 opinion
whether they will or no, merely because one of their predecessors has
maintained it⁷. So far does Cicero carry this freedom‚ that in the fifth'
book of the Tusculan Disputatt'ons he maintains 3 view entirely at
variance with the whole of the fourth book of the De fiinibus, and
when the discrepancy is pointed out, refuses to be bound by his
former statements‚ on the plen that he is 33 Academic and a free
man⁸. ‘Modo hoc modo illud probabilius uidetur⁰.' The Academic
sips the best of every school ¹⁰. He roams in the wide field of philoso-
phy, while the Stoic dares not stira foot's breadth away from Chry·
sippus¹¹. The Academic is only anxious that people should combat his
opinions, for he makes it his aim, with Socrates, to free himself and
others from the mists of error¹¹. If he finds it easier to detect error
