me that from the writing and ornamentation he would haue concluded
that the ns was probably written in the north of Holland. At the end
is this signatore: ‘per montes Theudorici hfiuolai Werken de Abbenbroech
liber explicit anno dommi ¹444' The writer was therefore evidentlya
Hollander, but he probably wrote in England. There are many beautiful
illuminations remaining, and many more have been cut out. Mr Brad-
shaw has shown mc that the ns was the gift of Archbishop Rotherham
to the Library, where it has remained for just upon four centuries.

On the margin are many notes ascribed to William of Malmesbury,
nearly all written in the first person, in such a way as' to show that this ns
is to be traced back to one actually annotated by William himself. The
notes consist not only of summaries of the arguments in the text, but of
numerous parallel passages from Cicero himself, and quotations from or
references to a great number of authors, among whom may be mentioned
particularly Augustino, Lactantius, Orosius, Iustinus, Valerius Maximus,
Flonts, Pliny the elder, Lucan, Macrobius, Jerome, the periochae of
Livy. These annotations really show very considerable reading and
research. William seems to have been especially interested in gathering
together fragments of lost works by Cicero, out of the ecclesiastical
writers. The following extracts from notes appended to the Lucullus
are of interest. After quoting from the outset of the De diuinatioue
a passage relating to the jour books of the Academica Posteriora, and
further from Augustine two passages concerning Varro, viz. the fragment
numbered 36 in my edition, and part of 1 ἓ 9, William says ‘hic liber
primus Achademicorum in Anglriu uon inuenitur, sed nec secreudus in quo
Catulus pro Achademicis disputans introducitur, sicut ex multis quiae in
hiis libris proxime scriptis animaduerti potest. Tertius oero et quartus
lrhrr Achodemicorum hiduo sunt qui proprie Lucullus appellantur, quia
in uno introducitur Lucullus contra Achademicos disputans, in altero
Tullius cipro Achademieis respondet! Although therefore William was
not acquainted with the letters of Cicero which disclose the secret of the
two editions, he had apprehended the divisions of the subject-matter
better than many recent scholars. He goes on thus: ‘duit idern Cr'cero
iu principio secundi libri de divinatione se composuisse librum in quo i'ntro
