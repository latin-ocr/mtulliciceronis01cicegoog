INTRODUCTION 5

philosophy; in Asia and at Rhodes he devoted himself principally to
rhetoric, under the guidance of the most noted Greek teachers, chief
of whom was his old friend Molo, the head of the Rhodian
school¹. Cicero however formed while at Rhodes one friendship which
largely influenced his views of philosophy, that with Posidonius the
pupil of Panaetius, the most famous Stoic of the age. Tohim Cicero
makes reference in his works oftener than to any other instructor. He
speaks of him as the greatest of the Stoics¹3 as a most notable philo·
sopher, to visit whom Pompey, in the midst of his eastern campaigns,
put himself to much trouble³ ; as a minute inquirer⁴. He is scarcely
ever mentioned without some expression of affection, and Cicero tells
us that he read his works more than those of any other Stoic author⁸.
Posidonius was at a later time resident at Rome⁶, and stayed in Cicero's
house. Hecato the Rhodian, another pupil of Panaetius, may have
been at Rhodes at this time. Mnesarchus and Dardanus, also hearers
of Panaetius, belonged to an earlier time, and although Cicero was
well acquainted with the works of the former, he does not seem to
have known either personally.

From the year 77 to the year 68 nc. when the series of letters
begins, Cicero was doubtless too busily engaged with legal and political
affairs to spend much time in systematic study. That his oratory owed
much to philosophy from the first he repeatedly insists 3 and we know
from his letters that it was his later practice to refresh his style by
much study of the Greek writers, and especially the philosophers.
During the period then, about which we bave little or no information‚
we may believe that he kept up his old knowledge by converse with
his many Roman friends who had a bent towards philosophy, as well
as with the Greeks who from time to time came to Rome and fre-
quented the houses of the optimates, to this intercourse he added such
reading as his leisure would allow. The letters contained in the first
book of those addressed to Atticus, which range over the years 68-62
ac.. afford many proofs of the abiding strength of his passion for
literary employment. ln the earlier part of this time we find him
entreating Atticus to let him have a library which was then for sale;
expressing at the same time in the strongest language his loathing for
public affairs, and his love for books, to which he looks as the support
of his old age⁷. In the midst of his busiest political occupations,
