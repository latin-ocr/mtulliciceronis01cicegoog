46 THE ACADEMICS OF CICERO.

Hortensius, and Cicero had gone over nearly the whole ground marked
out for the discussion ¹, but only cursorily, so that there was plenty of
room fora more minute examination in the Lucullus.

One question remains: how sar did Cicero defend Philo against the
attack of Catulus? Krische (followed by Engstrand) believes that the
argument of Catulus was answered point ‘by point. In this opinion I
cannot concur. Cicero never appears elsewhere as the defendet of Philo's
reactionary doctrines¹. The expressions os Lucullus seem to imply that
this part of his teaclring had been dismissed by all the disputants³. It
follows that when Cicero, in his letter of dedication to Varro, describes
his own part as that of Philo (partis uu'lu' sumpsi Plat'laaaas‘), he merely
attaches Philo’s name to those general New Academic doctrines which
had been so brilliantly supported by the pupil of Clitomachus in his
earlier days. The two chief sources for Cicero’s speech in the Catulus
were, as we shall see, Philo himself and Clitomachus.

In that intemrediate form os the Academica, where Cato and Brutus
appeared in the place ol Hortensius and Lucullus, there can beno
doubt that Brutus occupied a more prominent position than Cato.
Consequently Cato must have taken the comparativcly inferior'part of
Hortensius, while Brutus took that of Lucullus. It may perhaps seem
strange that a Stoic of the Stoics like Cato should be chosen to repre-
sent Antiochus, however much that philosopher may have borrowed
from Zeno. The rdle given to Hortensius, however, was in my view
such as any cultivated man might sustain who had not definitely com-
mitted himself to sceptical principles. So eminent an Antiochean as
Brutus cannot have been reduced to the comparatively secondary posi-
ῃ tion assigned to Hortensius in the Academica Priora. He would natu·
rally oecupy the place given to Varro in the second edition ⁵. If this be
true, Brutus would not speak at length in the first half of the work.
Cato is not closely enough connected with the Academica to render ir
necessary to treat of him farther.

c. Tae ‘Lucullus'

The day after the discussion narrated in the Catulus, during which
Lucullus had been merely a listener, the whole party left the Cumaean
villa of Catulus early in the morning, and came to that of Hortensius
