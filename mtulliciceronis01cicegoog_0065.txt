48 THE ACADEMICS OF CICERO.

when he went to Asia was the poet Archias, and during the whole of
his residence in the East he sought to attach learned men to his person.
At Alexandria he was found in the company os Antiochus, Aristus,
Heraclitus TyriuS, Tetrilius Rogus and the Selii, all men os philosophie
tastes¹. He is several times mentioned by Pliny in the Natural Ir'istory
as the patron os Greek artists. Yet, as we have already seen, Cicero
acknowledged in his letters to Atticus that Lucullus was no philosopher.
He has to be propped up, like Catulus by the authority of another
person. All his arguments are explicitly stated to be derived srorn a
discussion in which he had heard'Antiochus engage. The speech of
Lucullus was, as l have said, mainly a reply to that ol Cicero in the

· Catulus. Any closer examination of its contents must be postponed till

· ,Ι corne to annotate its actual text The same may be said of Cicero's
’- answer.

J In the intermediate form of the Academica, the speech of Lucullus

’ was no doubt transferred to Brutus, but as he has only such a slight

· connexion with the work, Ι do not think it necessary to do much more

than call attention to the fact. I may, however, notice the close rela-

tionship in which Brutus stood to the other persons with whom we have

had to deal. He was nephew os Cato, whose hallsister Servilia was
wife of Lucullus'. Cato was tutor to Lucullus' son, with Cicero sora

sort ol adviser: while Hortensius had married a divorced wife os Cato.
All of them were of the Senatorial party, and Cato and Brutus lived to
be present, with Cicero, during the war between Pompey and Caesar.

’ Brutus and Cicero were both friends of Antiochus and Aristus, whose

pupil Brutus was ⁸.

d. Τ lte Second Edt'tion.

When Cicero dedicated the Academica to Varro, very slight altera-
tions were necessary in the scenery and other accessories ol the pisce.
Cicero had avilla close to the Cumaean villa ol Catulus and almost within
sight ol Hortensius’ villa at Bauli⁴. Varro’s villa, at which the scene
was now laid, was close to the Lucrine lake⁶. With regard to the
leigned date os the discourse‚ we may observe that at the very outset of
