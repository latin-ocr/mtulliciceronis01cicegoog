18 THE ACADEMICS OF CICERO.

Cicero’s temperament led him to refuse it with horror¹. On some
¹ questions, as we have already seen, Cicero wavered. In the De
nauus he argued that the difference between the Stoic and Peri-
patetic ethics was merely one of terms3 in the Tusmlan Disputa-
tr'ons he held it to be real. The most Stoic in tone of all his works
are the Dcsculan Disputaaans and the De Officri's'.

The third branchos philosophy, that concemed with natural pheno·
mena, was in Cicero’s age accounted of small importance compared
nith ethics. Physical investigations were only valued for the effect they
might have on ethical speculation or practice. Cicero esteemed physical
science mainly as a form of culture⁸. The atomism of the Epicureans
and the pantheistic materialism of the Stoics were alike directed to secur·
ing for the wise man the perfect repose of mind which was necessary for
the full realisation of his ethical ideal. In all ancient systems, theology
was recognised as a division of natural science'. The religious element Α
in Cicero’s nature inclined him very strongly to sympathise with the
Stoic views of the grand universal operation of divine power. Piety,
purity, and moral good were impossible in any form, he thought, is
the divine govemment of the universe were denied⁴. He was grieved
that Carneades should have found it necessary to oppose the beautiful
Stoic theology, and he defends the great sceptic by the plea that his
one aim was to rouse men to the investigation of the truth⁶. The
fatalistic and pantheistic aspect of the Stoic physics, which was ac·
cepted by Antiochus⁶, Cicero rejected, as became a follower of Car·
neades, who had spent much of his life in ridiculing the Stoic εἱμαρμένη.
In the general outlines of physics, Cicero chiefly followed Antiochus,
whose scheme is propounded in the Academica Postcrrbra. That
philosopher, while owing much to the Stoics, drew largely upon the
Timacus of Plato, a work which Cicero knew and translated, though
like all other readers of the dialogue he found it hard to understand⁷.
Many of the Stoic notions which entered into the Antiochean physics
were ultimately derived from Aristotle, but the physical treatises of
that philosopher were in Cicero's time inaccessible‚ or at all events
