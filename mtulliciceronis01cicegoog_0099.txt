82 THE ACADEMICS OF CICERO.

nntic system like yours free from mistakes (114). You wish me to jola your school.
What am 1 to do then with my dear friend Diodotus, who thinks so poorly of
Antiochus? Let us consider however what system not 1. but the sapim is to adopt
(11⁵)-

(ὅ 116-118. Part tx of Cicero’s exposition. 'lhe discord of philosophers on
physical questions. Of the three parts of philosophy take Physics first. Would your
sapiens swear to the truth of any geometrieal result whatever? (116) Let ns see
which one of actual physical systems the sapisns we are secking will select (117). He
must choose one toacher from among the conflicting schools of Thales, Anaximander,
Anaximenes, Anaxagoras, Xenophanes, Leucippus, Democritus, Empedocles, Hera·
clitus, Melissus, Plato and Pythagoras. ‘Ibe remaining teachers, great men though
they be, he must reject (118). Whatever system he selects he must know absolutely;
if the Stoic, he must believe as strongly in the Stoic theology as he does in the sun·
light. If he holds this, Aristotle will pronounce him mad; you, however, Lucullus,
must defend the Stoics and spurn Aristotle from you, while you will not allow me
evento doubt (119). How much better to be free, as 1 am, and not compelled to
find an answer to all the riddles of the universe! (rso) Nothing can exist, say you,
spart from the deity. Strato, however, says he does not need the deity to construet
the universe. His mode of construction again differs from that of Democritus 1
see some good in Strato; yet Ι will not assent absolutely either to his system or to
yours (111). All these matters lie far beyond our ken. We know nothing of the
human body, which we cau dissect; while we have not the advantage of being able to
dissect the constitution of things, or of the earth to see whether she is frrmly tired or
hovers in mid air (111). Xenophanes, Hicetas, Plato and Epicurus tell strange things
of the heavenly bodies. How much better to side with Socrates and Aristo, who
hold that nothing can be known about them l (1²3) who kuows the nature of mind?
Numberless opinions clash, as do those of Dicaearchus, Plato aad Xenocrates. Our
sapiens will be unable to decide (114). ΙΙ you say it is better to choose any system
rather than none, Ι choose Democritus. You at once upbraid me for believing such
monstrous falsehoods (ta 5). The Stoics differ among themselves about physical sub·
jects3 why will they not allow meto differ from them? (126) Not that 1 deprecate
the study of Physics; for moral good results froru it (127). Our sapr'ens will be
delighted if he attalus to anything which seems to resemble truth. Before Ι procced
'to Ethics, Inote your weakness in placing all perceptions on the same level. You
must be prepared to asseverate no less strongly that the sun is eighteen times as large
as the earth, than that yon statue is six feet high. When you admit that all things
can be perceived no more and no less clearly than the siae of the sun, Iam almost
content (118). ¹

(ᾗ rap-141. Part x of Cicero’s exposition. The discord of philosophers on
ethical questions. What contentiori is there among philosophers about the ethical
standard! 1 pass by many abandoned systems like that of Herillusy but consider
the discrepancies between Xenophanes, Parmenides, Zeno of Elea, Euclides, Mene·
demus, Aristo, Pyrrho, Aristippus, Epicurus, Callipho, Hieronymus, Diodorus, Polemo,
Antiochus, Carneades (rap-131). If 1 desire to follow the Stoica, Antiochus will
not allow me3 while if 1 follow Polemo, the Stoics are irata (131). Ι must be careful
not to assent to the unknown, which is a dogma common to both you, Lucullus, and
myself (133). Zeno thinks virtue gives happiness. ‘Yes,' says Antiochum, ‘but not
the greatest possible‘ How am 1 to choose among such conflicting theorias? (134)
Nor can 1 accept those points in which Antiochus aad Zeno agree. For instance,
