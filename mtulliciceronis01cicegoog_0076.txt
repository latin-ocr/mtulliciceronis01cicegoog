seems to have set up a contrast between the exoteric and the esoteric
doctrines of the New Academy, though his opponents asked in vain
what the latter were¹, and Clitomachus, the pupil and successoros
Carneades, declared that he had never been able to discover the real
opinion of his master concerning any topic whatever⁹.

Philo then assigned his own positive reaching. whatever it was, to
his predecessors in the school. Cicero nowhere in the Acadenu‘ca
directly defends his accuracy on this point, but he does indirectly try '
to reestablish the impaired credit olbis favoun'te master. Thus he
repeatedly implies that the unfavourable judgnient pronounced upon
Philo was in great part caused by the failure of his critics to realise the
constructive doctrines of Carneades³.

The most probable conjecture about Philo's own opinion is, l think,
this. He maintained that the impressions of sense give in the vast
majority of instances a correct picture of the obiects which cause thern.
We may therefore make confident assertions as to their truth, where we
see no reason to suspect their falsehood. Only, while we may be sure that
in the overwh'elmingly larger number of instances our judgment will be
right, yet in no one particular instance can we be absolutely certain that
it is so. This conjecture accords with Philo’s vindication of the serious-
ness of Carneades' assertion that the perlectly wisc man will feel free to
pronounce definite opinions though he knows he cannot absolutely
prove them‘. We may suppose that this view agreed roughly with the
opinions of the Peripatetics at this timet lt would therefore seem a
substantial concession to dogmatism⁶.

One thing which closely concerns the Academica, but which is very
difficolt to determine, is the date at which Philo changed his opinions.
The view of Brandis⁷ that the two books which excited the wrath of
Antiochus were written before Philo carne to Rome, is exceedingly
improbable At the time when Cicero first heard his lectures, he almost
certainly taught nothing but the doctrine of Carneades. Now Philo's
