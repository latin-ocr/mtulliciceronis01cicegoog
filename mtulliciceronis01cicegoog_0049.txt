32 THE ACADEMICS OF CICERO.

The discussion in the Academico Priora is carried on at thevilla oi
Hortensius near Bauli 3 in the Hortensius at the villa ol Lucullus near
' Cumae It is rather surprising that under these circumstances there
should be only one direct reference to the Hortensius in the Lucullus.
The Academico in its original form was no doubt sent to Atticus
very soon aster Cicero reached Tusculum ¹. Probably Atticus, who
visited Cicero at Tusculum, made some objections to the way in which
Cicero had put learned arguments into the mouths ol unleamed men' ;
so Cicero took the book back and added to each division of it a new

introduction, returning the book sor Atticus' approval¹. In all proba·
bility the extant prooemium of the Lucullus is the one which Cicero

then affixed These prooemia constituted a deliberate attempt on the
partos Cicero to impose upon his readers a set ol statements concern·
· ing the intellectual ability and culture of Catulus and Lucullus which he
knew and in his own letters to Atticus admitted to be salse‘. Imay
note, as ol some interest in connexion with the Academico, that among
the unpleasant visits received by Cicero at Tusculum was one from
Varro⁵.

On the 21st June, Cicero lest Tusculum sor Arpinum, in order,
he says, to arrange some business connected with property there, and
also to relieve Brutus from the burden which his assiduous attentioris

imposed on hirn‘. Cicero seems to have been still unsatisfied with his
choice of interlocutors lor the Academico, and the first thing he didon
his arrival was to transfer the parts ol Lucullus and Hortensius to Cato
and Brutus; the part ol Catulus he probably added to his own⁷. This
plan was speedily cast aside on the arrival of a letter from Atticus,
strongly urging that the whole work should be dedicated to Varro, orii
