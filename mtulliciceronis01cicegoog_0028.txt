INTRODUCTION 11

Greek philosophy were, as Cicero often insists‚ oue dialectical‚ the
establishment ol 3 criterion‚ such as would suffice to distinguish the
true from the salse; and one ethical‚ the determination of the summum
bonum, or moral standard¹. It is convenient here to take the dialec-
tical problem first (though in the eyes ol the ancients it was infinitely
the less important of the two). All that was distinctive os the New
Aoedemy was its dialectic¹. lt proclaimed no peculiar views either in
ethics or in physics. As the Sceptical school os Pyrrho was practically
in abeyance'‚ the New Academy had lor its own especial property the
doctrine that man is so constituted as to be incapable of reaching
absolute 3ηά certain truth ⁴. It was by virtue os accepting this tenet
that Cicero became and on all occasions declared himselfa follower of
the New Academy.

Itis easy to see what there was iu this view to attract Cicero. His
mind was open and unprey'udiced, receptive and impressible, to an ex-
traordinary degree, and utterly uniitted lor a blind and deal defence ol
any lixed dogma. His temperameut also was gentle almost to sostness,
and he entirely lacked the robust confidence in sels which distinguishes
the dogrnatic controversialist. His experience as an orator also inclined
him towards the New Academy. He was accustomed to hear argu-
ments put lorward with equal persuasiveness on both sides osa case.
In other fields too it seemed to him arrogant to advance any proposi·
tion with a conviction ol its absolute, indestructible and irrefragable
truth. One requisite ol a philosophy with him was that it should
avoid this arrogance¹. Philosophers os the highest repute lor ability
and sincerity had held the most opposite opinions on the same sub-
jects‘. To withhold absolute assent from all doctrines, while giving
a qualihed assent to those which seemed most probable, was the only
prudent course⁷. The diversities os view which the most famous intel-
lects exhibit, ought, said Cicero, to incline thinkers towards charity 3ηά
toleration, aud to repel them lroru the sury of dogrnatism. hlen ought to
teach and enlighten one another in a spirit of gentleness and moderatiori ⁸.
