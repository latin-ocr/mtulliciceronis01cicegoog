INTRODUCTION. 73

possible, the loss would be greater than the gain. A thousand important
lessons in scholarship depeud ou the determination of the spelling used
at particular epochs and by different authors. The subject is however
too large to be pursued here. 1 would only point out one matter which
seems to meos the highest importauce. The study ol Latin inscriptions
gains in consequence every year. ll the principle were always followed
ol representing as nearly as possible the orthography actually 'employed
by each author, the student who passes from literature to inscriptions
would have as little as possible to unlearn. At present he must get n'd
ol a whole cargo os rubbish, which has not any antiquity to recommend
it, since it isa burden sor the most part cast upon scholarship by the
random etymology os the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries

In determining matters ol spelling even the best uss are but in-
different guides. Cicero wh0, as Quintilian tells us¹, was most punc·
tilious in his attention to orthography, would be aghast at Halm's text
os the Lucidius produced by adherence to the Leydeu and Vienna uss ¹.
The testimony ol inscriptions, andos ancient writers who have touched
on orthography, used as it has been used by Corssen, Fleckeisen, Bram-
bach and others is vastly more valuable. Yet the confirmatory evidence
ol our uss is often ol considerable importauce. For example, the
odious quum, to which many English scholars cling with such fondness,
is ol the rarest possible occurrence even in the most corrupt ol uss. Α ’
student might work at uss t'or years *without coming across a single
instance. To take another example, the uss ol Cicero, rightly con-
sidered, give strong support to the conclusion which is arrived at on
other grounds, that this author used -r' only, not -ai', in the genitive
singular ol nouns whose nominatives end in -ius or aiam. ln the ages
when the scribes wrote the employment os -r'i was universal, and the
temptation to change the -i into -ii was therefore intensely strong. Yet
some of our uss preserve the original form in as many cases as one in
live, a lact utterly incapable ol explanation on the supposition that the
form used by Cicero was that in -ιῖ,

l have been at pains to point out here and there in my notes the
true value ol the conclusions to be drawn from uss in matters ol spell-
ing, because it has rarely as yet been duly appreciated. It is perhaps
hardly necessary to warn readers that my orthography does not pretend
to be certain or final lt only represents the best results my studies
have enabled me to attain.
