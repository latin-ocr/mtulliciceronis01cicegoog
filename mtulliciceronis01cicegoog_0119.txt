102 M. TULLI CICERONIS [1119

malent qui erunt eruditi aut ne haec quidem qui illa nesciunt.
Sed da mihi nunc: satisne probas? Immo uero et haec qui illa 5
non poterunt et qui Graeca poterunt non contemnent sua. Quid
enim caussae est cur poetas Latinos Graecis litteris eruditi legant,
philosophos non legant? An quia delectat Ennius Pacuuius

Varro wrote tragedies, lyric and elegiae 1. tnoohaatt: the spelling inchoasti

Varro, who after all may not be our Varro,
hut Varro Atacinus. But again if V. had
already published so elaborate a work on
philosophy, it is inexplicable that Cic.
should have spoken of him throughout
this prologue as having merely dabbled in
philosophy. Finally, Ritschl seems to
take omni nunrcro in an impossible sense,
that of amnibus nnnrcrr‘s absolutum (so
Fore. s. v. nurncrus and others). Even
if onmi numera could bear this meaning,
the qualification sere would make the
· statement a ‘damning with faint praise’,
01 which Cic. is most unlikely to have
been guilty towards Varro. The true
interpretation has been overlooked from
its very simplicity: Cic. says to V. ‘in
almost every metre you have composed a
pocm’, i.e. 'there is hardly a metro in

mariana point the same way. Incokare
is, literally‚ ‘to sketch in outline’; the
old word cons (the h is an exam le of
improper aspimtion) meant ··h0l10w‘‚
being in fact a form of canas (corros) with
the u dropped between the vowels; cf.
in-sornrare and Gellius a, 3, 3. Ritschl is
no doubt right in thinking that theworks
referred to here arethe ‘libri logistorici '.
Neither the ‘de philosophia’ nor the
‘de forma philosophiae’ had as yet been
written. llence much of Krahner's argu·
ment about the context is baseless.
