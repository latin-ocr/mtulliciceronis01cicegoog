old editions the Lumllus is marked throughout as Academicorum liber I V.
This isan entire mistake, which arose from a wrong view of Nonius’
quotations, which are always from the second edition, and can tell us
nothing about the constitution of 'the first. One other thing is worth
remark Halm (as many before him had done) places the Academico
Priora before the Posteriora. This seems to me an unnatural arrange-

ment3 the subject-matter of the second edition is certainly prior,
logically‚ to that of the Lucullus.

ξ 5. On the Greek sources os tlrc ‘Academica ’.

It has been stated above (p. 24) that the philosophical works of . Α
Cicero were merely transcripts from the most approved Greek writings
on the subjects with which they deal. There is but little difficulty in
determining the Greek materials which were used in the construction of
the Academico. The arguments in favour of dogmatism are frequently
stated by Cicero to be wholly taken from his old macher, Antiochus of
Ascalon ¹. That Cicero did not relyon his own recollection of Antiochus’
lectures, but transcribed the opinions from a book or books by the master,

can be clearly proved, though the fact is nowhere definitely stated. The ἱ
historical review of Greek philosophy down to the time of Arcesilas,
which Cicero puts into Varro's mouth in the Academica Posteriora, bears

in every line the stamp of direct and close translation. It is in fact a
brief dogmatic statement of the peculiar views of Antiochus, given
under cover of an historieal retrospect. Tradition has not preserved to
us the name of any work to which this portion of the Academica may be
distinctly referred¹. That it was a well-recognised and authoritative
statement of Antiochus' system, is clear from the close verbal agreement
ol Varro's speech with other passages in Cicero professedly drawn from
Antiochus, and also with the Antiochean fragments of Varro preserved
by Augustine⁸.

ln the Academico Priora Lucullus reproduces the criticisms of An·
tiochus upon the scepticism of the New Academy. Cicero makes Lu-
cullus say that he repeats the arguments of Antiochus from recollection
of oral discussions in which that philosopher took part. But this state

developed only one particular thesis. ³Forproofsof this agreement see my
bfuch the same may be said of the book notes on the text of Varro's speech.
