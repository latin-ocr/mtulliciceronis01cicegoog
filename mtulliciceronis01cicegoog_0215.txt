renaici solo putantueri esse iudicium, quia sentiatur? Potestne
igitur quisquam dicere inter eum, qui doleat, et inter eum, qui in
ro uoluptate sit, nihil interesse, aut, ita qui sentiet non apertissime
insaniat? Atqui qualia sunt haec, quae sensibus percipi dicimus, 21
talia secuntur ea, quae non sensibus ipsis percipi dicuntur, sed
quodam modo sensibus, ut haec: ‘illud est album, hoc dulce,

uitiosa: this word has been osten
regarded as spurious, but on no intelli·
gible grounds: It simply means ‘desec-
tive'‚ ‘incomplete'‚ a sense which excel·
lently suits the oonteit, and one ol which
instances are numerous.

7. interiorem: see nn. on 5 76, froin
which it will be seen to be astonishing
that a dogmatist should have ventured to
quote the Cyrenaics as iavourable to his
views. Antiochus must have done so, as
Cicero's Latin here has all the appear·
ance ol being closely translated from the
‘Sosus’.

Cyrenaics the νόθοι ol the mind was the

and the following from Sext. Α. Μ. 7,

that the two passages agree very closely.
'l'he express notioris which were pro-

the language used clearly points to a
