leals praemio: an unusual expres·
sion, which has generally been regarded
as a variation sor r'egr's beneficio ‘thanks
to a certain enactrnent'. The Latinity
ol the phrase has been hastily denied by
those who have condemned the prologue
to the Lucullus as spurious. We have
an exact parallel in Balb. 57 legum
praemiis ‘rewards testing on, or depend-
mg on, statutes'. The similar usage ol
beneficio followed by agen. with the
sense ol ‘thanks to’ is very common in
the whole οῖ’ latin prose literature ; so
