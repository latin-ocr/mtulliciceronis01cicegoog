30 THE ACADEMICS OF CICERO.

school¹; who were then the most noted πολιτικοὶ at Athens¹. The
meaning of the last question is made clear by a passage in the De
Oratore, where Cicero speaks of the combined Academic and Peri·
patetic schools under that name³. It may be with reference to the
Academica among other works that in a later letter he expresses him·
self satished with the progress he has made in his literary undertak-
ings⁴. During the remainder of his sojoum at Astura he continued to
be actively employed, but though he speaks of some other literary
projects, we find no express mention in his letters to Atticus of ¹the
Acadenrica. A few days before leaving Astura he declared that however
much his detractors might reproach him with inaction, they c'ould not
read the numerous works on which he had been engaged, within the
same time that he had taken to compose them⁵.

On the 14th May⁶, Cicero left Astura for Tusculum, which ⁸he
reached on the following day, having spent a night at Lanuvium. It
had eost him a great effort to make up his mind to seek again the house
where Tullia had died⁷. The day before he lest Astura, Cicero informed
Atticus that he had finished (‘ absolui ’) duo taragna oovrdypara³. These
words have caused much difference of opinion among scholars. Madvig⁹
(following many earlier writers) interprets the words to refer to the
Academica and the De Finibus. But insuperable obsacles stand in the
way of this opinion ¹⁰. Nothing can be more certain than that the Dc
mathus was still in an incomplete condition when Cicero left Astura¹¹.
