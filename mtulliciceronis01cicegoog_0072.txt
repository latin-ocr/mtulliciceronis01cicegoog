two assumptions greatly limit the scope of the ancient discussion as com-
pared with the modern. The problem was this: given a world oi ‘things
in themselves' existing independently os human consciousness, given
also the impressions ol sense as the sole ultimate source os insonnation
conceming that world, to what extent can these impressions be trusted?
The Epicureans boldly said that every impression ol sense is true and
trustwortby, and did not shrink from some os the most absurd con·
seduences to which this principle led them, though they tn'ed to escape
from others by leeble quibbling¹. Zeno, on the other hand, began by
aclmowledging that the impressions ol sense must be divided into two

classes, the true and the salse, and proceeded to give a delinition ol a ·

true impressiore A true impression, he said, enables the healthy
mind ‘to seize on' the obJect, and to feel certain that the object has
been rightly apprehended. This irresistible conviction is the sole
test ol truth. 'Knowledge, which is certain and admits of no degrees,
must be built up on these ‘irresistible impressions' Alter the time
ot Zeno, the whole controversy conceming the possibility of certitude
turned as on a pivot upon the Stoic definition ol theindividual
‘irresistible impression’ (καταληπτικὴ φαντασία). It was assumed that
is the definition could be invalidated, the edifiqe ol knowledge crumbled
away from its base.

Τὴε sceptic school ol Pyrrho practically died out with Timon of
Phlius, and was only revived after Cicero’s death'. But the mantle of
Pyrrho really lell on Arcesilas, the founder os the New Academic
school. He spent his lile in combating the definition ol the unitos
knowledge given by the Stoics, and his scepticism was practically
indistinguishable from that ol Pyrrho. His position was modified by
Carneades, whose negative criticism was as brilliant as that ol Arcesilas,
but who introduced positive teaching in the shape os what may be
called a calculus os probabilities. While Arcesilas held that the
moment we begin to examine any impression of sense, we shall find
that the arguments lor and against its trustworthiness exactly balance
each other, Carneades thought that the scale would generally incline
decisively in one direction or the other, so that although certitude is
unattainable, various degrees ot probability are within our reach.
