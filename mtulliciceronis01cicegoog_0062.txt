Old, and also, in its views regarding the foundations of knowledge, with
those ancient philosophers who preceded Plato. Lucullus, therefore,
reproves him as a rebel in philosophy, who appeals to great and ancient
names like a seditious tribune¹. Unfair use had been made, according
to Lucullus, of Empedocles Anaxagoras, Democritus, Parmenides,
Xenophanes, Plato, and Socrates¹. But Cicero did not merely give a
historical summary. He must have dealt with the theory of κατα-
ληπτικὴ φαντασία and ἔννοιαι (which though really Stoic had been
adopted by Antiochus), since he found lt necessary to ‘manufactum'
(jawisan) Latin terms to represent the Greek³. He probably also
commented on the headlong rashness with which the dogmatists gave
their assent to the truth of phenomena To this a retortis made by
· Lucullus‘. That Cicero's criticism of the dogmatic schools was, in this
speech, incomplete and merely preliminary, may be seen by the fact that
he found no occasion to Latinise such terms as κατάληψις (ie in the
v abstract, as opposed to the individual καταληπτικὴ φαντασία), ἐνάργεια,
ὁρμή, ἅτοδιίξις, δόγμα, οἰκεῖον, ἄδηλα, ἐποχή, nearly all important terms
in the Stoic‚ and to some extent in the Antiochean system, all of
which Lucullus is obliged to translate for himself⁵. The more the
matter is examined the more clearly does it appear that the main

purpose of Cicero in this speech was to justify from the history of
philosophy the position of the New Academy, and not to advance
sceptical arguments against experience, which were reserved for his
answer to Lucullus. In the later speech, he expressly tells us that such
sceptical paradoxes as were put forward by him in the first day’s dis·

course were really out of place, and were merely introduced in order to
disarm Lucullus, who was to spealr next⁶. Yet these arguments must
have occupied some considerable space in Cicero's speech, although
foreign to its main intention ¹. He probably gave a summary classifica·
tion of the sensationS, with the reasons for refusing to assent to the truth
of each class'. The whole constitution and tenor of the elaborate
speech of Cicero in the Lucullus proves that no general or minute
. demonstration of the impossibility of ἐπιστήμη in the dogmatic sense
had been attempted in his statement of the day before. Cicero's argu·
ment in the Catulus was allowed by Lucullus to have considerably

, named the cause of Antiochus’. The three speeches of Catulus,
