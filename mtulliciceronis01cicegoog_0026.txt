INTRODUCTION. 9

a politician. In these evil days, however, no occupation was long to
his taste ; books, letters, study, all in their turn became unpleasant ¹.
As soon as Cicero had become sully reconciled to Caesar in the
year 46 he returned with desperate energy to his old literary pursuits
In a letter written to Varro in that year', he says, ‘I assure youI
had no sooner returned to Rome than I renewed my intimacy with
my old friends, my books.’ These gave him real comfort, and his
studies seemed to bear richer fruit than in his days os prosperity³.
The tenor ol all his letters at this time is the same: see especially the
remaining letters to Varro and also to Sulpicius ⁴. The Portt'tioncs

Oratam, the Paradoxa, the Orator, and the Mudatio Catonis, to
which Caesar replied by his Anticato, were all fmished within the year.
Before the end of the year the Hortensius and the Dc Finibus had
probably both been planned and commenced. Early in the following
year the Acodom'co, the history ol which Ι shall trace elsewhere, was
wntten.

l have now finished the first portion of my task; I have shown
Cicero as the man os letters and the student os philosophy during that
portion of his lise which preceded the writing os the Academico. Even
the evidence I have produced, which does not include such indirect
indications of philosophical study as might be obtained from the actual
philosophica] works of Cicero, is sufficient to justify his boast that at no
time had he been divorced from philosophy ⁵. He was entitled to meet
the charge made by some people on the publication os his first book
ol the later period-the Hortensius-that he was a mere tiro in phi-
losophy, by the assertion that on the contrary nothing had more oc·
cupied his thoughts throughout the whole os a svondersully energetic
lise‘. His knowledge ol philosophy must of course be estimated ulti·
mately by his extant works. These have been severely judged by some
leading scholars of recent times, but on wholly insufficient grounds.
The tide must one day turn, indeed is even now turning, and due grati-
tude will again be selt and expressed lor the man who has preserved to
