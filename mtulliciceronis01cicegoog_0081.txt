64 aaa Acroawrcs‘ or cicaro.

r. Α. In the possession oi S. Allen, Esq.‚ of Dublin¹, who inherited
it from his father, H. Allen, Esq.‚ well known to students ol Cicero by
his Latinised name ‘Henricus Alanus! This us is a small quarto,
written on parchment with great care; few mistakes in it can be ascribed
to the copyist. In parts the ink is rubbed away, but the forms oi the
letters are so deeply impressed on the parchment that, with care, the
readings can always be made out. The contents are-Academica Poste-
rr'ora, De legibus, De natura deorum, De divinitatt'one, De fato, Timaeus,
(De mundo), Somnium Sceptonis. At the end comes Acadanica Ι. with
this title, ‘M. T. Ciceronis fragmentorum de Acadonais! It concludes
with the words ex Epicureo Zenom in ἓ 46, and ·has no proper subscrip-
tion, but merely the remark ‘non repepere'tar (sic) plus! Thenas bears
the book-plate ol the well-known Conrad von Uffenbach, who probably
brought it from Italy⁵. It afterwards became the property ol Creuzer,
who used itin preparing his editions ol the De legibm aud De natura
deorum. The collation which Halm used was supplied to him by the
owner (‘ Henricus Alanus ’) himself, and is very rarely inaccurate or
incomplete. Only in a lew instances have I been able to correct or
supplement it.

2. Al, Also the property oi Mr Allen. This us has not been
collated before so far as Ι know. It is a small folio, written in Italy on
paper, and not older than the latter hall os the xvth century. The ns
(the writing os which is careless in many parts) contains only the Tuscu-
lan Disputations, and the first book ol the Academe'co Posteriora down to
et aem in ἓ 28, where it breaks off. What remains is evidently only a
portion os a much larger rus Blank spaces are leit where illuminated
letters stood in the original from which it was copied. On the ily-leaf is
written ‘from the Rev. John Mitford's sale'.‘

3. Harl. 1. No. 3593 oi the Harleian collection in the British
Museum. Written in Italy, on paper, towards the end of the xvth
century, with blank spaces lor initial letters. The handwriting is small,

. and the orthography on the whole good. The ms contains only the De
finebus and Α cadernr'ca J.

4. Harl. 2. No. 6327 in the Harleian collection. Written on
paper 5 belongs to the very end os the xvth cent. or even to the begin-
ning os the xvrth. Contains both the Academica Priora and Posteriora.
A good many errors.
