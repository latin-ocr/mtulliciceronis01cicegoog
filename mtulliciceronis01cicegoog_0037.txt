20 THE ACADEMICS OF CICERO.

53. On tlte aim os Cicero in writing his philosophical works, aad
their character.

In the preceding sections some idea hasbeen conveyed of the
intellectual atmosphere in which Cicero lived, and the opinions con-
ceming philosophy which he adopted. For the right appreciation of
his philosophical works‚ one thing more is wanted, a clear notion of
the objects he set before himself in writing them, and of the conditions
under which they were written. Many of his modern critics have not
had the patience to inquire what it was that he set himself to accom-
plish‚ aud have condemned him for not achiem'ng what he never
intended to achieve

We have already seen that the last idea which could have entered
into the mind of Cicero or his contemporaries would have been that of
creatiug a new philosophy. He depended entirely on his predecessors‚
and so drew necessarily upon Greek sources. There is not one of
his works (if we except the third book of the De Officiis), which he
does not freely admit to have been derived from the Greek.

When Cicero began to write, Latin may be said to have been desti-
tute of a philosophical literature. Philosophy was a sealed study to
those who were not thoroughly familiar with Greeks That the culti·
vated Roman public had some superficial acquaintance with the names
and leading characteristico of the chief Greek philosophers is shown
by the allusions which meet us in the Roman literature of the stage
from an early period¹. But this slight and dim knowledge came entirely
through Greek sources Down to Cicero’s time there wasa strong
prejudice against the teaching of philosophy in Latin, similar to that
which led Antonius the orator in his consulship to close the schools
of the teachers of rhetoric who gave their lessons in Latin. Throughout
his life Cicero was a strong advocate for the use of Latin in im·
parting all forms of culture to the Roman youth'.
