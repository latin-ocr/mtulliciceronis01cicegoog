unread, even by the Peripatetics themselves¹. The later Peripatetics
had adopted many Stoic doctrines in physics, as in ethics and dialectic,
which they at the same time gave out as Aristotelian. Hence Antio
chus, and Cicero with him, often supposed himself to be following
Aristode, when he was really treading in the track ol Zeno.

Thus lar 1 have spoken almost entirely ol the effect produced on
Cicero’s mind hythe ethical and physical speculations of the Stoics and
Antiochus, inasmuch as these teachers intluenced him more powerlully
than any others Very few words are needed to characterize his esti-
mate of the Peripatetic and Epicurean schools. The former was not
very powersully represented in his time. Peripateticisnr had long since
been penetrated through and through by the spirit os Stoicism. The
Peripatetic teachers of Cicero's age appear to have contined themselves
almost entirely to the discussion ol ethical questions, and in the treat-
ment οἱ these they were osten only divided lrom the Stoics by the finest
ol lines’. The principal point in dispute between the two schools· was
whether (as the Stoics said) virtue was the sole constituent ol happiness,
or whether (as the Peripatetics maintained) other endowments contri-
buted to happiness, though to an utterly infinitesimal extent One
curious fact shews the decadenee ol the Peripatetic school at this time:
the intellectual descendants ol the author ol the ‘Organon’ were

notorious lor their ignorance ol logic'. While not much intluenced by
the school, Cicero generally treats it tenderly lor the sake ol its great
past, deeming it a worthy branch ol the true Socratic family. His
feeling for the Epicureans was wholly different. Though he osten com-

pliments them on their gentle dispositions and their love lor one
another⁴, he expresses nothing but contempt and loathing lor their
philosophy. In physics they stood as absolutely alone as did the
New Academy in dialectic; their system was grossly unintellectual
and they dispensed with the use ol mathematics⁵. Their ethical doc-
trincs excited in Cicero only disgust3 dialectic they eschewed, and
they crowned all their errors by a sin which the great orator could never
pardon. lor they were completely indifferent to every adomment ancl

beauty ol language.'
