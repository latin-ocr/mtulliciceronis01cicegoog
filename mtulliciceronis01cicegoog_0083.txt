It is evident from what has been stated that, although a good many
mss exist of Acud. I which have never been collated‚ or have been only
partially collated, any future examination of uss is not likely to contri·
bute much to the study of this portion of the work.

As regards the text of the fragments of the Academico Posteriora, the
most important of which are preserved by Nonius, 1 have made careful
· use of the edition of Nouius by Quicherat (Paris 1872).

b. The mss of the Lucullus.

The following are the rrss referred to in my critical notes, where all
the readings of any consequence are quoted.

1. V. AVienna rrs of the xth cent ln Endlicher’s catalogue
(1836)=N0. ιν. In the new catalogue (1856)=No. 189. This ms
breaks off at the words autnon iu 5 104.

3. R Another Leyden ns ; xrrth cent.¹

4 Ε. Ms of Erlangen3 no. 847. A paper us, dated 1466, and

of this us in editing the Definibus.

5. G. ‘Codex Gudianus secunduS‚’ now at Wolfenblittel. Alarge
parchment folio, of the xrvth cent, written in France. This ‘iugens
uolumcn⁸’ comprises a great portion of Cicero’s writings.
