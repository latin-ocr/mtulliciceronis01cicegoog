78 THE ACADEMICS OF CICERO.

§5 40—42. Part v of Lucullus’ exposition: statement of the method pursued by
the Academics. The Academics have a regular method. They first give a general
definition of sensation and then lay down the different classes of sensations. Then
they put forward their two strong arguments: (ι) things which produce :exsudans
such as might have been produced in the same form by other things, cannot be partly
capable of being perceived, partly not capable: (a) sensatione must be assumed to be
of the same form if our faculties do not enable us to distinguish between them. Then
they proceed: Senaations are some of them true, others false: the false cannot of
course be real perceptiones, while the trite are always of a form which the false may
assume. Now sensations which are indistinguishable from false sensatione cannot be
in some cases perceptionem others not. There is therefore no sensadon which is
also a perception (40). Two admissione, they say. are universally made, (ι) false
sensatione cannot be perceptione, (a) sensatione which are indistinguishable from false,
cannot be in some cases perceptions, in others not. 'lhe following two assertions
they strive to prove: (r) sensations are in some cases true. iu others false, (a) every
sensation which proceeds from a reality, has a form which it might have if it pro·
ceeded from no reality (41). Το prove these propositione, they divide perceptione
into those which are sensatione, and those which are deduced from sensatione: after
which they show that credit cannot be given to either class (42). [Τὴε word ‘per-
ception' is used to mean ‘a certainly known sensation']

ἐς 43-45. Part w of Lucullus’ exposition: preliminary criticism of the Aca·
demic method. 'l’he sceptics ought not to detine, for (1) a definition cannot be a defini-
tion of two things, (a) if the definition is applicable only to one thing, that thing must
be capable of being thoroughly known and distinguished from others (43). For the
purposes of reasoning their probabile is not enough. Reasoning can only proceed
upon certain premisses Again to say that there are false sensatione is to say that
there are true ones: you acknowledge therefore a difierence, then you contradict
yourselves ‘aud say there is none (44). Let us discuss the matter farther. The
innate clearness of uisa, aided by reason, can lead to knowledge (45).

ἕξ 46—53· Part vn of Lucullus’ exposition. The Academica owe their popularity
to the use of logical fallacies. 'ibe refusal of people to assent to the innate clearness
of some phenomena (ἐνάργεια) is due to two causes: (ι) they do not make a serious
endeavour to see the light by which these phenomena are surrounded ; (a) their faith is
shaken by sceptic paradoxas (46). The sceptics argue thus: you allow that mere phan-
tom-sensatione are often seen in dreams, why then do you not allow what is easier,
that two sensations caused by two really existing things may be mistaken the one for
the other? (47). Further, they urge that a phantom-sensatior produces very often
the same effect as a real one. 'Ihe dogmatists say they admit that mere phantom-sen·

’ sations do command assent. Why, say the Academica, should the dogmatista not

admit that these phantom-sensations command assent when they so closely resemble
real ones as to be indistinguishable from them? (48). Antiochus attacked these
arguments as soritae. and therefore faulty (49). Tm admission of a certain amount
of similarity between true and false sensations does not logically lead to the impos·
sibility of distinguishing between the true and the false (50). We contend that these
phantom-sensations lack that selfevidcnce which we require before giving assent.
When we have wakened from the dream, we make light of the sensatione we had
while in it (5ι). But, say our opponents, while they last our dreaming sensatione
are as vivid as our waking ones. This we deny (52). ‘But‚‘ say they, ‘yon allow
that the wise man in madness withholds his assent-⁹ This proves nothing, for he
