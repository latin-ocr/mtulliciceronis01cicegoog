literature’ with that marvellous man Dionysius¹, and laughingly
pronouncing that nothing is sweeter than universal knowledge. He
spent great part of the year 55 at Cumae or Naples ‘feeding upon’
the library of Faustus Sulla, the son of the dictator¹. Literature formed
then, he tells us, his solace and support, and he would rather sit in
a garden seat which Atticus possessed, beneath a bust of Aristotle, than
in the ivory chair of ollice. Towards the end of the year he was
busily engaged on the De Oratore, a work which clearly proves his
continued familiarity with Greek philosophy'. In the following year (54)
he writes that politics must cease for him, and that he therefore returns
unreservedly to the life most in accordance with nature, that of the
student⁴. During this year he was again for the most part resident at
those of his country villas where his best collections of books were.
At this time was written the De republica, a work to which 1 may
appeal for evidence that his old philosophical studies bad by no means
been allowed to drop⁸. Aristotle is especially mentioned as one of
the authors read at this time‘. In the year 5² ac. came the De
Legibus, written amid distracting occupations; a work professedly
modelled on Plato and the older philosophers of the Socratic schools².
In the year 5¹ Cicero, thenon bis way to Cilicia, revisited Athens,
much to his own pleasure and that of the Athenians. He stayed in
the house of Aristus, the brother of Antiochus and teacher of Brutus.
His acquaintance with this philosopher was lasting, if we may judge
from the affectionate mention of him in the Brutus⁸. Cicero also speaks
in kindly terms of Xeno, an Epicurean friend of Atticus, who was then
with Patro at Athens. It was at this time that Cicero interfered to
prevent Memmius, the patron of the great Roman Epicurean Lucretius,
from destroying the house in which Epicums had lived'. Cicero seems
to have been somewhat disappointed with the state of philosophy at
AthenS, Aristus being the only man of merit then resident there'⁰. On
the ioumey from Athens to his province, he made the acquaintance
of Cratippus, who afterwards taught at Athens as head of the Peripatetic
school¹¹. At this time Cratippus came to visit Cicero at Mitylene, where
the orator seems to have passed some time in his society¹¹. He was by
