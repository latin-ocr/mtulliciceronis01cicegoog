the third book.

Besides the actual fragments oi the second edition, many indicatious oi its con·
tents are preserved in the work ol Augustine entitled Contra Acadenn'cos, which,
though written in support ol dogmatic opinions, imitated throughout the second
edition ol the Academico ol Cic. No writings ol the Classical period bad so great an
influence on the culture and opinions oi Augustino as the Academica aud the lost
Hortensius. I 've‚ partly from Krische, the seattered indications ol the contenis of
the sormer whicblare to be guthered from the bishop’s works. In Aug. Contr. Ac. 11.
14, 15, we have what appears to be a summary oi the lost part of Book Ito the
following effect. The New Academy must not be regarded as aving revolted ngahlst
the Old; all that it did was to diseuss that new doctrine oi κατάληψίς advanced by
Zeno. The doctrine os ἀκαταληψὶα though present to the minds oi the ancients had
never taken distinct shape, because it had met with no opposition. 'lhe Old Academy
was rather enriched than attached by the New. Antiochus, in adoptin Stoicism
under the name ol the Old Academy, made it appear that there was a sude between
it and the New. With Antiochus the historica exposition of Cic. must bave ended.
From this portion os the first book, Aug. derived his o inion (Contra Ac. 11. ι) that
New Academicism was excusable from the necessities oltbe age in which it appeared.
Indications ol Book II in Aug. arc scarce, but to it I reser Contra Ac. 1. 7 placuit
Ciceroni nostro beatum esse qui uermn irrucstrgat ctiam si ad cius inuentionern non
ualeat peruenire ,· also ibid. 111. ro illis (Academicis) placuit esse posse bominem
sapientem, et tantm in bominem scientiam caelen non posse. 'lbese I referto cicero's
development oi the probabile in Book Il, although l ought to say that Krische p. 65
maintains that the substance oi Catulus’ ex osition in the Ac. Priora was transferred
to Book IV oi the Ac. Posteriora. As diis would leave very meage material for
Book ΙΙ, nothing indeed excepting the provisional proof os the deceptiveness of the
senses.1 cannot accede to his arrangement ς mine, I nray remark, involves a much
smaller departure srorn the first edition. Allusions in Aug. to the attack on the senses
by Cic. in Book II arc diffieult to hx, as they apply equally well to the later attack
in Book IV. As to Books ΙΙΙ and IV, Ι do not think it necessary here to rove
srom Aug. the points oi agreement between them and the Lucullus. which will ind a
better place in my notes on the latter, but merely give the divergences which appear
srom other sources. These are the translation os σοφίσματα by carrillationcs in Luc. 75
(Seneca ep. ιιι), and the insertion in 118 oscitantia as a translation ol obolo.
