68 THE ACADEMICS OF CICERO.

deroin. Quod si miclsi non crcditur, quinta eiusdem ieronimi ad aratorem
magnum urbis ronrae legatur! Then follows the well-known passage
from the third book os Augustine’s Confessions which tells how he
attributed his conversion to the reading os Cicero's Hortensius. This
is succeeded by the fragment oi the Hortensius numbered 50 in
C. F. W. Miiller’s edition, quoted from Augustine’s De trinitate. ·

The orthography oi the us is in many respects good. T he spelling
oi Greek names in particular is better than in most uss.

ot these nine use, Ι have collated 7, 8, 9 myself. The readings ol
6are taken srom the Oxiord edition oi 1783 ; those oi the rest irum .
Halm.

It has been supposed by many scholars that all existing uss oi the
De natura deorum, De diurnatione, Timaeus, De fato, Topica, Paradoxa,
Lucullus and De legatus are traceable to a single original. The evidence
offered ior this conclusion does not satissy me, but it would be out ol
place to discuss it here. C. F. W. Miiller has elaborately examined
(Nem Ialrrtriclrer, 1864, pp. 127sq.; 261 sq.) the relation oi the uss
above marked ABV to the archetype, but his conclusions are oi little
value ior the study of the text oi the Academica. Miller attributes
importance to a us oi the xth cent. at Munich, which still (so iar as 1
know) remains uncollated.

c. In addition to the readings oi the uss described above, l have
often quoted those os the Roman printed edition of ¹471 which repre·
sents, in the Academica Posteriora, a somewhat different recension ol the
text from that contained in our nss The readings of this edition are
marked r. Further, l have given in all important cases the readings
adoptedby three recent editors, whose opinion on all matters connected
with Ciceronian criticism is entitled to a respectful hearing. These
are Halm (H in the critical notes), Baiter (B) who published in 1863
along with Kayser a complete text ol Cic'er0‚ and C. F. ll'. Miiller
