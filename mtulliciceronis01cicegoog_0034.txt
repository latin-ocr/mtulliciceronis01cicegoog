to assure to moral principles a sound basis had for Cicero a great at·
traction He was, in his later days, bascinated by the Stoics almost
beyond the power os resistance. In respect of their ethical and religi·
ous ideas he calls them ‘great and famous philosophers¹,' and he sre-
quently speaks with something like shame os the treatment they had
received at the hands os Arcesilas and Carneades. Once he expresses a
tear lest they should be the only true philosophers aster all¹. There was
a magnificence about the Stoic utterances on morality, more suited to a
superhumau thau a human world, which allured Cicero more than the
barrenness os the Stoic dialectic repelled him'. In a remarkable pas·
suget, he assentsto the distinctively Stoic doctrine that virtue is incapable
ol degree, and expressly rejects the position of Antiochus that a life
enriched by virtue but unattended by other advantages might be happy,
but could not be the happiest possible. He begs the Academic and
Peripatetic Schools to cease from giving an uncertain sound⁶, and to
allow that the happiness os the wise man would remain unimpaired
even is he were thrust into the bull of Phalaris. In another place he
admits the purely Stoic doctrine that virtue is one and indivisible⁶.
'I'hese opinions, however, he will not allow to be distinctively Stoic, but
appeals to Socrates as his authority sor them ¹. Zeno, who is merely an
ignobte‘cmnsman of words, stole thern from the older philosophers of
the Academy. This is Cicero's general feeling with regard to Zeno,
and there can be no doubt that he caught it from Antiochus who, in
sterling the doctrines of Zeno, ever stoutly maintained that Zeno had
stolen them before. Cicero, however, regarded chiefly the ethics os
Zeno with this feeling, while Antiochus so regarded chiefly the dialectic.
lt is justin this that the main difference between Antiochus and Cicero
lies To the former Zeuo's dialectic was true and Socratic, while the
latter treated it as un·Socratic, looking upon Socrates as the apostle of
doubt⁸. On the whole Cicero went beyond Antiochus in his sympathy
with the Stoic ethics. Not at every point, however, sor while Antio
chus accepted without reserve the Stoic paradoxes, Cicero hesitatingly
allowed them, though he admitted that they were Socratic’. Again,
Antiochus subscribed to the Stoic theory that all emotion wassinfu13
