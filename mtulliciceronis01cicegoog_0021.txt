4 THE ACADEMICS OF CICERO.

explicitly stated. Cicero must at this period have attained an almost
complete familiarity with the Epicurean doctrines.

There seems to have been no eminent representative os the Stoic
school then living at Athens. Nor is any mention made os a Peripatetic
teacher whose lectures Cicero might have attended, though M. Pupius
Piso, a professed Peripatetic, was one of his companions in this sojoum
at Athens¹. Only three notable Peripatetics were at this time living.
Os these Staseas os Naples, who lived some time in Piso’s house, was
not then at Athens⁹3 it is probable, however, from a mention os him

in the De Oratore, that Cicero knew him through Piso. Diodorus,

’ the pupil of Critolaus is frequently named by Cicer0, but never as
an acquaintance. Cratippus was at this time unknown to him.

The philosopher from whose lessons Cicero certainly learned most
ἲ at this period was Antiochus os Ascalon, now the representative os
a Stoicised Academic school. Of this teacher, however, I shall have
to treat later, when Ι shall attempt to estimate the influence he exer·
cised over our author. It is sufficient here to say that on the main
point which was in controversy between Philo and Antiochus, Cicero
still continued to think with his earlier teacher. His later workS,
however, make it evident that he set a high value on the abilities and
the learning of AntiochuS, especially in dialectic, which was taught by
him after Stoic principles. Cicero speaks of him as eminent among
the philosophers of the time, both sor talent and acquirement⁸; as a
man os acute intellect‘; as possessed of a pointed style⁵; in fine,
as the most cultivated and keenest philosopher of the age⁶. A corr-
siderable friendship sprang up between Antiochus and Cicer0⁷, which
was strengthened by the fact that many friends os the latter, such as
Piso⁸, Varro, Lucullus and Brutus, more or less adhered to the views
of Antiochus. It is improbable that Cicero at this time became
acquainted with Aristus the brother of Antiochus, since in the Aca-
demico⁹ he is mentioned in such a way as to show that he was unknown
to Cicero in nc. 62.
