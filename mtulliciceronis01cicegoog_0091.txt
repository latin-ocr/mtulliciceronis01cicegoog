ἕξ 1-14. Prooemium Cic. Varro aud Atticus meet at Cumae (1). Cimber
adroitly reminding Varro that the promised dedication of the De lingua Latina is too
long delayed, tums the conversation towards philosophy, byasking Varro why he leaves ’
this subject untouched (a, 3). Varro thinks philosophy written in Latin can serve no
useful purpose, and points to the failures of the Roman Epicureans (4-6). He
greatly believes in philosophy, but prefers to send his friends to Greece for it, while he
devotes himself to subjects which the Greeks have not treated (7, 8). Cic. lauds this
devotion, but demurs to the theory that philosophy written in Latin isuseless. Latius
may surely imitate Greek philosophers as well as Greek poets and orators. He gives
reasons why he should himself make the attempt, and instancing the success of Brutus,
again begs Varro to write on philosophy (9-12). Varro putting the request on one
side charges Cic. with deserting the Old Academy for the New. Cic. defends him-
seli, and appeals to Philo for the statement that the N ew Academy is iu harmony with
the Old. Varro refers to Antiochus as an authority on the other side. This lerds to
a proposal on the part of Cic. to discuss thoroughly the difference between Antiochus
and Philo. Varro agrees, and promises an exposition of the principles of Antiochus
(1 ,14).

3§§ 15-18. Part 1 of Varro's exposition: Antiochus' view of the history of
Philosophy. Socrates rejected physics and made ethics supreme in philosophy (15).
He had no fixed tenets; his one doctrine being that wisdom consists iu a consciousness
of ignorance. Moral exhortation was his task (16). Plato added to and enriched the
teaching of his masten from him sprang two schools which abandoned the negative
position of Socrates and adopted definite tenets. yet remained in essential agreement
with one another—the Peripatetic and the Academic (ry, 18).

§§ 19—23. Part 11 of Varro's exposition: Antiochus' Etkr'cs. The threefold
division of philosophy 1111οὴ01111), φυσική, aerari. Goodness implies obedienoe to
nature; happiness the acqu'uition of natural advantages. These are of three kinds.
mental, bodily, and external. The bodily are described (¹9lt then the mentm, which
fall into two classes, congenital aud acquired, virtue being the chief of the required
(ao); then the externat, which form with the bodily advantages a kind of exercise·
ground for virtue (a 1). The ethical standard is theu succinctly stated, ln which virtue
has chief part, and is capable in itself of producing happiness, though not the greatest
happiness possible, which requires the possession of all three classes of advantages
(aa). With this ethical standard, it is possible to give an intelligent account of action
and duty (23).

(θη-191 Part 111 of Varro’s exposition: Antiochus' Physica. All thetis
consists of force and matter, which are never actually found apart, though they are
thought of as separate. When force impresses form on the formless matter, 11 becomes
a formed entity (ποιόν τι or quaid-(ul. These formed entities are either prinam or
recondary. Air, tire, water, earth are primary3 the two first havingan active, the two
last a passive function. Aristotle added a fifth primary substance (26). Underlying
all formed entities is the formless matter; matter and space are infinitely subdivisible
(27). Force or form acts on the formless matter and so produces the ordered universe,
