mental, is the logical outcome of scepticism. If the seuses are healthy and unim-
paired, they give perfectly true information about external things. Not that I main·
tain the truth of every sensation; Epicurus must see to that. Obstaeles which
impede the action of the senses must always be removed; in practice we always
do remove them where we can (19). What power the cultivated senses of painters
and musicians have! How keen is the sense of touchl (no). After the perceptions
of sense come the equally clear perceptions of the mind, which are in a certain way
perceptions of sense, since they come through sense; these rise in complexity till
we arrive at definitions and ideas (τι). If these ideas may possibly be false, then
logie, memory‚ and all kinds of arts are at once rendered impossible (aa). That true
perception is possible, is seen from moral action. Who would act, if the things on
which he takes action might prove to be false? (23). llow‘can wisdom he wisdom
if she has nothing certain to guide her? There must be some ground on which action
cen proceed (24). Credence must be given to the phenomena which impel us to
action, otherwise aetion is impossible (25). The doctrines of the New Academy
would put an end to all processes of reasoning. The fleeting a'nd uncertain can
never be discovered. Rational proof requires that something, once veiled, should
be brought to light (τό). Syllogisms are'by scepticism rendered useless ; philosophy
too cannot exist unless her dogmas have a sure basis (η). Hence the Academics
have been urged to allow their dogma, that perception is impossible. to be a certain
perception of their minds. This, Carneades said, would be inconsistent, since the
very dogma excludes the supposition that there can be any true perception (28).
Antiochus declared that the Academics could not be held to be philosophers if they
bad not even confidence in their one dogma (29).

ssya-36. Part 111 of Lucullus’ exposition: nature has formed men for the
attainmeut of certitude, and no substitute which the sceptics offer is of any use.
With respect to physical sciente, we might urge that nature has constructed man
with great art. llis mind is naturally formed for the attainment of knowledge
(3ο). For this purpose the mind uses the senses, and so gradually arrives at virtue,
which is the perfection of the resson. Those then who deny that any certainty
cen be attaiued through the sertses, throw the whole of life into confusion (31).
Some sceptics say ‘we cannot help it! Others distinguish between the absolute
absence of certainty, and the denial of its absolute presence. Let us deal with
these rather thau with the former (32). Now they on the one hand profess to distin·
guish between true and false, and on the other hold that no absolutely certain method
for distinguisbing between true and false is possible (33). This is absurd; a thing
cannot be known at all unless by such marks as can appertain to no other thing.
llow can a thing be said to be ‘evidently white,’ if the possibility remeius that it
rnay be really black? Agrin, how ean a thing be ‘evident’ at all if it may be afler
all a mere phantom (34)? There is no definite mark, say the sceptics, by which a
thing may be known. Their ‘probability’ then is mere random guess·worlr (33).
Even if they only profess to decide after careful ponderiug of the circumstances, we
reply that a decision which is still possibly false is useless (36).
