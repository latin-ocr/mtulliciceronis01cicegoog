seen, entirely written at Astura and Arpinum. But even had it been
otherwise the title Academicae Qrcaesttanes could only mean ‘particular
problerns discussed in the Academia,' a title entirely unsuited to a work
which gives a complete exposition of the principles of a whole school.
The title is equally unsuitable if, with some editors (Ernesti and others),
we take it to mean ‘problems connected with the Academic school¹.'
out it is more than doubtful whether Cicero could ever have called his
villa at Puteoli by the name ‘Academia' Pliny seems to have founded
his statement on an epigram concerning the villa which he quotes, and
which speaks of ‘Academiae celebratam nomine villam! Now it was
the custom for the wealthy Romans of Cicero's day to give to certain
shaded walks around their country houses the title Academia or Lya'rcm.
Cicero had both a Lyciam and an Academia at Tusculum². He may
also have had an Academia in his grounds at Puteoli, though we have
no evidence of the fact, or his successor in the villa (which no doubt
soon became a show place for tourists) may have given the name to one
of the walks or terraces.

As to the subsequent fate of the two editions, we can only gather
¹ scanty information from quotations. The second edition was saroftener
referred to than the first. No fragments have been preserved which
can with probability be referred to the lost portion of the earlier edition.
lactantius, Angustiae, Nonius and Diomedes quote always the Aca-
demica Paslenara. The work is usually quoted under the title Academica,
though Lactantius sometimes, and Angustiae always used the name libri
Academici Quintilian knew both recensions³, Plutarch only the earlier⁴.
The quotations of Ammianus Marcellinus seem to be from the Aca·

the genesis of the book, as gathered from Cicero’s letters to Atticus
Τ hat it was not unnecessary to do so may be seen from the astounding
theories which old scholars of great repute put forward concerning the
two recensions⁶, and from the blunders which are still occasionally made
by unwary editors of Cicero's philosophical works⁷.
