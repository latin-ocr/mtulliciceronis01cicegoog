b. rue lost dr'ulugue ‘catulusffl

The whole of the characters in this dialogue and the Lucullus are
among those genuine Optimates and adherents of the senatorial party
whom Cicero so loves to honour. The Catulus from whom the lost
dialogue was named was son of the illustrious colleague of Marius.
With the political career of father and son we shall have little to do. I
merely inquire what was their position with respect to the philosophy of
the time, and the nature of their connexion with Cicero,

Catulus the younger need not detuin us long. lt is clear from the
Lucullus' that he did little more in the dialogue than put forward opinions
he had received from his father. Cicero would doubtless have preferred
to introduce the elder man as speaking for himself, but in that case, as
in the De Oratore, the author would have been compelled to exclude
himself from the conversation'. The son, therefore, is merely the mouth·
piece of the father, just as Lucullus, in the dialogue which bears his
name, does nothing but render literally a speech of Antiochus, which he
professes to have heard¹. For the arrangement in the case of both a
reason is to be found in their ἅτριψία with respect to philosophy‘. This
ἆτριψία did not amount to ἀπαιδευσία, or else Cicero could not have

made Catulus the younger the advocate of philosophy in the Hurtcusrus⁵.
Though Cicero sometimes classes the father and son together as men of
literary culture and perfect masters of Latin style, it is quite evident on a
comparison of all the passages where the two are mentioned, that no

very high value was placed on the learning of the son⁶. But however ,

slight were the claims of Catulus the younger to be considered a philo
sopher, he was closely linked to Cicero by other ties. During all the
most brilliant period of Cicero's life, Catulus was one of the foremost
Optimates of Rome, and his character, life, and influence are often
depicted in even extravagant language by the orator⁷. He is one of the
pillars of the state', Cicero eries, and deserves to be classed with the
ancient worthies of Rome’. When he opposes the Manilian law, and
asks the people on whom they would rely if Pompey, with such gigantic
power concentrated in his hands, were to die, the people answer with
