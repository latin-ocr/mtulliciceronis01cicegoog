16 ' THE ACADEMICS OF CICERO.

as expounded by Antiochus¹. As Cicero is on the very point of
attacking the Antiochean dialectic, his approval can only be intended
to refer to the ethical and physical sides of Antiochus’ system As the
duty of doubt and the theory of probability had not been set forth
in any work, either Greek or Roman, for thirty or forty years,
Cicero’s advocacy of the Philonian dialectic might well appear to
Varro as an act of desertion¹. It must also be remembered, whenever
Cicero speaks of the ‘uetus Academia,’ that he dissented entirely from
that estimare of Plato's early successors, for which Antiochus contended,
and maintained that from Socrates to Philo no Academic teacher had
been a dogmatist, so that to speak of an Old and a New Academy was
amistake'.

We can now pass to Cicero’s view of the ethical problem. The
determination of an ethical standard was in the eyes of the post-Aristo·
telian philosophers the grand purpose, end and aim of philosophy,
which was emphatically defined as ‘the art of conduct' or ‘the art
of living’ (ars uruendi⁴). All speculative and nonethical doctrines
were merely estimable a's supplying a basis on which this practical art
could be reared This is equally true of Pyrrho’s scepticism and of
the dogmatism of Zeno and Epicurus. If the dogmatists objected to
the dialectic of the N ew Academy, it was only because in their opinion
it logically led to the subversion of morality⁵. Cicero is therefore
greatly concerned in the Lucullus to prove that probability is suf·
ficient to allord that stable basis for moral practice which he felt to be
necessary. The New Academics generally took finner ground in ethical
matters than the Sceptics⁶, and Cicero often went beyond his own friends
in this respect Thus in the De Legibus, when the conversation
tums on a question in morals, he begs the⁴ New Academy, which has
introduced confusion into these subjects, to be silent⁷. There can be
no doubt that Cicero was deeply influenced throughout his life by
the scheme of ethics which he had learned from Antiochus ln all
Cicero‘s works which touch on moral or political questions that philo·
sopher is mentioned with great respect⁸. But all systems which seemed
