14 THE Acauaurrcs or cranao.

an Eclectic¹. It may be questioned whether the title is suited to any
of the ancient writers on philosophy. At any rate the application of the
name to Cicero, without strict limitation and definition, may easily lead,
as it has led, to serious misconceptions regarding his position. Many of
the writers who dub Cicero ‘eclectio’ appear to think that they thereby
cast on him a grave reproach. The note or mark ol eclecticism present
to the minds of these writers is wantos originality. Now to charge
Cicero with wantos originality betrays a failure to catch the spirit os
the age in which he lived It was an age os exposition and com-
mentation, not an age ol original thought, and this is just as true os the
Greek world at that period as of the Roman. No substantially novel
views of philosophy had been propounded since the time of Carneades,
indeed we might say since the timeor Arcesilas. lt was tacitly assumed
⁸ on all hands that any one who pursued philosophy must needs attach
himself to one of the existing schools There was absolutely no
demand whatever tor views of truth which professed to be new¹.
Originality in a philosopher, sar from being looked upon as a merit,
would rather have been treated as asin. Changes indeed, most pro·
found and momentous, were in progress. Old dogmas and formulas
were continually on the lips of the philosophers, and old controversial
battles were incessantly fought over again, yet the spirit os the corn·
batants was, vastly different from that of their intellectual foresathers.
The change however did not proceed from the speculations ol any in·
· dividuals, but was part ol a general movement in culture and society.
Further, to speak of Cicero as an ‘eclectic' is to lead unwary
readers to misapprehend‚ in particular, the standpoint ot the New
Academy. The eclectio makes it his business to appropriate parts
ol different systems, and weave them into a consistent whole. But
the New Academy was bound by the very condition of its existence to
resrain from inculcating any particular doctrines. Its one iunction was
to breathe into its disciples the spirit of criticism, to drive out lrom
their minds that confident spirit of dogmatic assertion‚ which like some
wild and savage monster (so Cicero has it³) dominated the adherents
os all the other philosophias. This task accomplished‚ the New Aca-
demy lest its alumni absolutely free to accept any tenets whatever.
They were bound to consider all arguments which could be advanced
sor or against all doctrines, and then, striking a balance of probabilities,
