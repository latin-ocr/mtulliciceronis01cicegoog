50 THE ACADEMICS OF CICERO.

Cicero. The negotiations between Atticus and Cicero with respect
to the dedication of the second edition, as detailed already, prove
sufficiently that this slight increase in cordiality did not lead to
friendship ¹.

The philosophical views of Varro can be gathered with tolerable
accuracy from Angustiae, who quotes considerably from the work of
Varro De Philosophid. Beyond doubt he was a follower of Antiochus
and the socalled Old Academy. How, by an elaborate and pedantic
process of exhaustion, he selected this school from among the 288
philosophies which he considered possible, may be read by the curious
in Augustine. My notes on the Academica Posteriora will show that
there is no reason for acensing Cicero of having mistaken Varro's
philosophical views. This supposition owes its currency to K. Ο.
Miiller, who, from Stoic phrases in the De lingua Latina, concluded
that Varro had passed over to the Stoics before that work was written.
All that was Stoic in Varro came from Antiochns⁸.

The exact specification of the changes in the arrangement of the
subject-matter, necessitated by the dedication to Varro, will be more

conveniently deferred till we come to the fragments of the second
edition preserved by Nonius and oth'ers. Roughly speaking, the follow-
ing were the contents of the four books. Book I.: the historico-philo
sophical exposition of Antiochus¹ views, formerly given by Hortensius,
now by Varro; then the historical justification of the Philonian position,
which Cicero had given in the first edition asan answer to Hortensins⁴.
Book IL: an exposition by Cicero of Cameades' positive teaching, prac-
tically the same as that given by Catulus in ed 1.; to this was appended,
probably, that foretaste of the negative arguments against dogmatism,
which in ed. 1. had formed part of the answer made by Cicero to Hor-
tensius. Book III.: a speech of Varro in reply to Cicero, closely
corresponding to that of Lucullus in ed. 1. Book lV.: Cicero’s answer,
substantially the same as in ed. r. Atticus must have been almost a
κωφὸν πρόσοητονῦ.
