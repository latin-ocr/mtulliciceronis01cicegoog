been so written, the work ol Zeller sar transcends the rest in
importance t'or such studies as those with which Ι have been
here concemed.

Some illustrative matter which Ι had intended to include in
the notes has been abandoned from wantos space. ln particular
l hoped to indicate throughout the work the relation in which

the doctrines discussed in the Academica stand to similar·
doctrines put t'orward in modern times. Ι trust that it may be
possible sor me'to deal with this subject in a separate publica-

tion at some future time.

The scantiness ol my leisure has prevented me from passing
the work rapidly through the press; hence some irregularities
and changes os plan have crept in lor which 1 owe an apology to
the reader. Some os these are mentioned in the “Addenda and
Corrigenda.” The index has been prepared with special care, and
Ι hope it will render the book uselul in some degree as a work
ol reference. The plan ol' writing the critical notes in Latin is
so obviously convenient and hasbeen so extensively adopted
that it needs no apology.
