INTRODUCTION 27

very imperfectly developed- state. Contradictions which appear
modern reader superficial and glaring are passed over without
iving by even a Plato oran Aristotle. In the sense lor orderly
rgement and regular development os arguments, and in stringency
te use ol technical termS, the whole ol the ancient philosophy is

deficient when judged by a modern standard¹. Now ol all the ,

ksystems the worst iu these respects was that with which Cicero
most to deal, the Stoic Itis not too much to say that it was, in
maiis, a tangled weh os inconsistencies‚ even as expounded by its
est authorities'.

t is very seldom that we can bring a passage of Cicero face to
with the Greek passage lrom which it was translated. Diogenes
tius, Stobaens, and other writers ol their class give us asa rule only
general impressions ol the different philosophies‚ without naming
portioris os the ancient writings. lrom which they drew the im·
tions. Opinions are vaguely put down to ‘Chrysippus’ or ‘the
s,’ and so on. When assertione of this kind conflict with asser·
ascribed to the same persons by Cicero, scholars hav'e been too
y to jump to the conclusion that Cicero has blundered. They
lorgotten that what Chrysippus maintained in one work he denied
lother, and that the Stoic system took very different forms in the
ths os its different exponents. Confirmations ol Cicero's accuracy
ι come to light in the most unexpectcd quartem, and unless a
lar can conscientiously say that he has examined every ancient
ige which bears upon any point in question, he will be very rash
ronouncing dogmatically that Cicero is in error³. Even where
:onbrmation exists elsewhere, it is always possible and generally
able that we have some isolated utterance which Cicero alone
preserved.
