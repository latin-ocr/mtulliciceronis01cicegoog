INTRODUCTION.

ξ 1. Cicero as man os letters and student of philosophy.

Ir would seem that Cicero's love for literature was inherited from his
father, who, being of ‘infirm health‚ lived constantly at Arpinum, and
spent the greater part of his time in study¹. From him was probably
derived that strong love for the old Latin dramatic and epic poetry
which his son throughout his writings displays. He too, we may con-
jecture, led the young Cicero to feel the importance ofa study of
philosophy to serve as a corrective for the somewhat narrow rhetorical
discipline of the time'.

Cicero's hrst systematic lessons in philosophy were given him by the
Epicurean Phaedrus, then at Rome because of the unsettled state of
Athens His lectures Cicero attended at avery early age, even before he
had assumed thc toga virilis The pupil seems to have been converted
at once to the tenets of the master'. Phaedrus remained to the end of
his life a friend of Cicero, who speaks warmly in praise of his teacher's
amiable disposition and rehned style. He is the only Epicurean, with,
perhaps, the exception of Lucretius, whom the orator ever allows to
possess any literary power⁴. Cicero soon abandoned Epicureanism,
but his schoolfellow‚ T. Pomponius Atticus, received more lasting
impressions from the teaching of Phaedms. It was probably at this
period of their lives that Atticus and his friend became acquainted
with Patro, who succeeded Phaedrus as head of the Epicurean school'.
