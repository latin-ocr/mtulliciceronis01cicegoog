62 THE ACADEMICS OF CICERO.

produced by obJ'ects vary when the subject is placed under varying
conditions os spuee¹. This line ol attack was so thoroughly hackneyed
that Cicero did not expend much trouble in pursuing it'. Sixthly‚ the
effect produced by variations in other external conditions besides those
os position was considered. Each sensation is affected by and mixed
up with other sensations aud these act aud react upon one another¹.
This observation is not developed in the Academica, though it is involved
in several passages⁴. In the seveuth place, Sextus argues that disserent
quantities ol the same material substance will make very different im·
pressions on the senseS, and render it impossible to pronounce what the
real qualities of the substance are⁵. This contentiori received only
slight attention from Cicero⁶. The eighth sceptical method really sums
up in a general lorm all the other nine. It shows that all judgmeut
which follows on sensation is relative to or conditioned by either the
peculiarities of the individual subject, or the external circumstances by
which sensation is accompanied⁷. This principle in its general form is
nowhere exactly stated in the Academica. Nor are the two succeeding
τρόποι represented there. The ninth is based on the difference which
it makes to our judgment whether an object is os rare or frequent occur-
rence⁸3 the tenth relates to the great variety os habits and manaem and
social ideas prevailing among different nations⁹.

Τ hese ten τρόποι were more or less common to the earlier sceptics
and the New Academy, but in clearness and thoroughness Aenesidemus
made a conspicuous advanee‚ both upon Pyrrho and upon Carneades¹⁰.

Of the five ‘methods’ adopted by the younger scepties¹¹, one is
identical with the eighth of the earlier scheme while another, based on
the discord os human judgments ¹², sums up most, if not all, ol the re·
